1. Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, led an army, which included Ionian and Aeolian Greeks, against Amasis for the following reason. Cambyses had asked Amasis for his daughter's hand in marriage, based on the advice of an Egyptian who was angry with Amasis. This Egyptian was upset because Amasis had taken him away from his family and sent him to Persia when Cyrus asked for the best eye-doctor in Egypt. The Egyptian wanted Amasis to suffer by either giving his daughter away or making an enemy of Cambyses by refusing. Amasis, afraid of Persia's power, didn't know whether to give his daughter away or refuse. He knew Cambyses didn't want her as a wife, but as a concubine. So, Amasis came up with a plan. He took Nitetis, the tall and beautiful daughter of the former king Apries, dressed her in fine clothes and gold, and sent her to Cambyses pretending she was his own daughter. After some time, as Cambyses embraced Nitetis, she told him the truth: "O King, you don't know how Amasis tricked you. He dressed me up and sent me to you as his own daughter, but I am actually the daughter of Apries, the ruler Amasis overthrew and killed with the help of the Egyptians." This revelation and the deceit made Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, furious and determined to attack Egypt. That's what the Persians say. 
2. The Egyptians claim that Cambyses was the son of Apries' daughter and therefore one of their own. They say that it was Cyrus, not Cambyses, who asked Amasis for his daughter. However, this is not true. The Egyptians know the Persian customs well and should be aware that illegitimate children cannot rule if there are legitimate heirs. They should also know that Cambyses was the son of Cassandane, the daughter of Pharnaspes, who was an Achaemenid, not the Egyptian woman. The Egyptians are making up this story to pretend they are related to Cyrus' family. That's the real truth. 
3. There's an unbelievable story that goes like this: A Persian woman visited Cyrus' wives and saw the tall and good-looking children of Cassandane, Cyrus' wife. She praised them highly. Cassandane then said, "Even though I am the mother of these children, Cyrus ignores me and favors his new woman from Egypt." She was upset about Nitetis. Hearing this, Cambyses, her oldest son, who was about ten years old, said, "Don't worry, mother. When I grow up, I'll turn Egypt upside down." The women were shocked by his words, but Cambyses remembered his promise. So, when he became king, he launched an attack on Egypt. 
4. There was another event that contributed to the campaign against Egypt. A skilled soldier named Phanes, originally from Halicarnassus, had a disagreement with Amasis. He decided to leave Egypt by ship and speak with Cambyses. Phanes was well-respected among the mercenaries and knew a lot about Egypt, so Amasis wanted to capture him. He sent a trusted eunuch with a ship to chase Phanes down. The eunuch caught Phanes in Lycia, but couldn't bring him back to Egypt because Phanes outsmarted him by getting his guards drunk and escaping to Persia. In Persia, Phanes found Cambyses ready to attack Egypt but unsure about how to cross the waterless desert. Phanes informed Cambyses about Amasis' situation and advised him on the best route. He suggested that Cambyses should ask the king of the Arabians for safe passage. 
5. The most common way to enter Egypt is as follows. The road starts from Phoenicia and goes to the city of Cadytis, which is part of the region known as Palestine in Syria. Cadytis is a large city, almost the size of Sardis. From Cadytis to the city of Ienysus, the coastal areas belong to the Arabians. After Ienysus, the areas become Syrian again, up to the Serbonian marsh, near the Casian promontory that extends towards the sea. Beyond the Serbonian marsh, where Typho is believed to have hidden, lies Egypt. Between Ienysus, the Casian mountain, and the Serbonian marsh, there is a vast and extremely dry area that takes about three days to cross. 
6. I'm going to share something that not many people who travel to Egypt know. Twice a year, ships bring earthen jars full of wine to Egypt from Greece and Phoenicia. However, you would be surprised to find that there are hardly any empty wine jars in the country. So, what happens to them? I'll explain. Each district governor must collect all the earthen pots from their area and take them to Memphis. The people of Memphis then fill these pots with water and transport them to the dry regions of Syria. So, the earthen jars that are brought to Egypt and emptied there are carried to Syria, where they join the existing stock. 
7. As soon as the Persians conquered Egypt, they took charge of the entrance to the country and made sure it had a water supply, just as I described earlier. However, at that time, there was no readily available water source. So, Cambyses listened to the advice of the man from Halicarnassus and sent messengers to the Arabian king. They asked for and received permission to pass through the region safely, exchanging promises with the Arabian king. 
8. The Arabians are known for highly valuing promises. When they make a pledge, a man stands between the two parties involved. Using a sharp stone, he cuts the palms of their hands near the thumb. Then, he takes a piece of wood from each person's cloak and uses their blood to mark seven stones that lie between them. During this process, he calls upon the gods Dionysus and the Heavenly Aphrodite. Once this is done, the person who made the pledge introduces the stranger (or fellow countryman) to his friends, who also feel obligated to honor the promise. The Arabians believe in only two gods: Dionysus and the Heavenly Aphrodite. They claim to wear their hair in a similar style to Dionysus, cutting it around the head and shaving the temples. They refer to Dionysus as Orotalt and Aphrodite as Alilat. 
9. When the Arabian king made a promise to the messengers from Cambyses, he came up with a clever plan. He filled camel-skins with water and loaded them onto his camels. Then, he took them to the waterless land and waited for Cambyses' army to arrive. This is the most believable story, but I'll also share a less credible one since it's often told. In Arabia, there's a large river called Corys that flows into the Red Sea. Some say that the Arabian king brought water from this river to the dry region using a long aqueduct made of sewn oxhides and other hides. He also dug large tanks in the desert to store the water. The river is a twelve-day journey from the desert, and it's said that he brought water to three different places using three separate aqueducts. 
10. Psammenitus, the son of Amasis, was waiting for Cambyses near the Pelusian mouth of the Nile River. When Cambyses set out to conquer Egypt, he discovered that Amasis had already passed away. Amasis had ruled for forty-four years without facing any significant misfortune. After his death, he was embalmed and placed in a tomb built for him in the temple. During Psammenitus' reign in Egypt, the people witnessed a remarkable event: rain fell in Thebes, a city where, according to the Thebans, it had never rained before and hasn't since, at least up until my time. In fact, the upper regions of Egypt rarely experience any rainfall. However, on that particular occasion, a light drizzle occurred in Thebes. 
11. When the Persians crossed the waterless region and set up camp near the Egyptians, preparing for battle, the Egyptian mercenaries, who were Greeks and Carians, came up with a plan to punish Phanes. They were angry at him for bringing a foreign army into Egypt. Phanes had left his sons in Egypt, so the mercenaries brought them to the camp where their father could see them. They placed a large bowl between the two armies and then brought the sons one by one, slitting their throats over the bowl. After all the sons were killed, they poured wine and water into the bowl, and the mercenaries drank from it before going into battle. The fight was intense, with many casualties on both sides. However, in the end, the Egyptians were defeated. 
12. I witnessed a peculiar sight at the site of the battle, which the locals had told me about. The bones of those killed from both sides were scattered separately - the Persian bones in one area and the Egyptian bones in another, reflecting where the two armies had initially stood. The skulls of the Persians were so fragile that even a small pebble could pierce them, while the Egyptian skulls were so strong that a stone's blow would barely crack them. The people explained, and I found it easy to believe, that this was because Egyptians shaved their heads from childhood, causing the bone to thicken due to sun exposure. This also prevented them from going bald, as there are very few bald people in Egypt. So, their skulls were strong for this reason. On the other hand, the Persian skulls were weak because they wore felt hats, called tiaras, throughout their lives. This observation held true when I saw the skulls of the Persians at Papremis, who were killed alongside Darius' son Achaemenes by Inaros the Libyan - their skulls were just as fragile as the others. 
13. After losing the battle, the Egyptians retreated in chaos. When they were caught in Memphis, Cambyses sent a Persian messenger on a Mytilenean boat up the river to propose peace to the Egyptians. However, when the Egyptians saw the boat approaching Memphis, they rushed out from their walls, destroyed the boat, dismembered its crew, and took them back inside the walls. As a result, the Egyptians were besieged and eventually surrendered. Seeing what happened in Egypt, the neighboring Libyans decided to surrender without a fight. They imposed a tribute on themselves and sent gifts, as did the people of Cyrene and Barca, who were also frightened like the Libyans. Cambyses graciously accepted the gifts from the Libyans, but he was not pleased with what he received from Cyrene. The Cyrenaeans had sent only five hundred silver minae, which Cambyses thought was too little. In his displeasure, he threw the silver among his army. 
14. Ten days after the surrender of the walled city of Memphis, Cambyses captured Psammenitus, the king of Egypt who had ruled for six months. He confined him in the outer part of the city with other Egyptians, intending to humiliate him. To test Psammenitus' spirit, Cambyses dressed the king's daughter as a slave and sent her to fetch water with a pitcher, along with other girls from prominent families who were also dressed as slaves. As the girls went out crying and lamenting in front of their fathers, the other Egyptians responded with tears and sorrow, seeing their children mistreated. However, Psammenitus simply bowed to the ground upon seeing his daughter. Next, Cambyses sent Psammenitus' son out with two thousand other young Egyptians, all with ropes around their necks and bits in their mouths. They were to be punished for the deaths of the Mytileneans who had perished with their boat at Memphis. The royal judges had decreed that for each man's death, ten noble Egyptians should die. Upon seeing his son being led to his death, Psammenitus reacted as he had when he saw his daughter. All the Egyptians with him wept and showed their grief. Afterward, an old companion of Psammenitus, who had lost all his possessions and was now a poor beggar, passed by. Seeing him, Psammenitus burst into tears, struck his head, and called out his companion's name. Cambyses had placed spies to watch Psammenitus and report his actions. Puzzled by the king's behavior, Cambyses sent a messenger to ask why Psammenitus had not cried or wept for his daughter and son, but had shown such emotion for the beggar, who was not even a relative. Psammenitus replied, "Son of Cyrus, my personal grief was too great for tears, but the misfortune of my companion, who has fallen from wealth and prosperity to begging in his old age, deserves tears." Cambyses and his court reportedly found the answer to be wise. The Egyptians say that even Croesus, who had accompanied Cambyses to Egypt, and the Persians present wept. Cambyses himself felt some pity and ordered that Psammenitus' son be spared from execution. He also commanded that Psammenitus be brought in from the outer part of the city and presented before him. 
15. When the men went to fetch Psammenitus' son, they discovered that he had already been killed, being the first to be executed. However, they brought Psammenitus to Cambyses, where he lived without any harm for the rest of his life. If Psammenitus had been content with his situation, he could have regained control of Egypt, as the Persians tend to honor the sons of kings. Even if kings rebel against them, they often restore power to their sons. This custom is evident in the cases of Thannyras, son of Inaros, and Pausiris, son of Amyrtaeus, both of whom were given back their fathers' power despite the harm their fathers had caused the Persians. However, Psammenitus chose to plot against Cambyses and was caught trying to incite a rebellion among the Egyptians. When Cambyses learned of this, Psammenitus was forced to drink bull's blood, which led to his death. That was the end of Psammenitus. 
16. Cambyses went from Memphis to the city of Sais, intending to carry out a specific plan. He entered the house of Amasis and had Amasis' body removed from its burial place. Once this was done, he ordered the body to be whipped, have its hair pulled out, and be pierced with goads, desecrating it in every possible way. When they grew tired of this, and the embalmed body remained intact, Cambyses commanded them to burn it. This was a sacrilegious order, as the Persians consider fire to be a god and neither nation believes in burning the dead. The Persians think it's wrong to give a dead body to a god, while the Egyptians believe fire is a living creature that consumes everything it catches and dies along with its meal. This is why Egyptians embalm corpses, to prevent them from being consumed by worms. Cambyses' command went against the customs of both peoples. However, the Egyptians claim that it was not Amasis' body that was desecrated, but that of another Egyptian of the same age. They say the Persians mistreated this body, thinking it was Amasis'. According to the Egyptians, Amasis had learned from an oracle about what would happen to his body after his death. To avoid this fate, he buried the other man near the door of his own tomb and instructed his son to place his own body in the farthest corner of the tomb. I believe that these commands from Amasis, regarding the burial place and the other man, were never given and that the Egyptians have faith in this story without reason. 
17. Following these events, Cambyses planned three campaigns: one against the Carthaginians, another against the Ammonians, and a third against the "long-lived" Ethiopians who lived in the part of Libya bordering the southern sea. After some thought, he decided to send his naval fleet against the Carthaginians and a portion of his land army against the Ammonians. As for Ethiopia, he planned to first send spies to verify the existence of the legendary "Table of the Sun" and gather other information, under the guise of bringing gifts to the Ethiopian king. 
18. The "Table of the Sun" is described as follows: There is a meadow outside the city, filled with cooked meat from various four-legged animals. The city's leaders make sure to lay out the meat during the night, and throughout the day, anyone who wants to can come and enjoy the feast. The locals believe that the earth itself provides these meats. This is the story of the "Table of the Sun." 
19. When Cambyses decided to send spies, he called for the Fish-eaters from the city of Elephantine who spoke the Ethiopian language. While they were being brought to him, he ordered his fleet to sail against Carthage. However, the Phoenicians refused, stating that they were bound by strong oaths and attacking their own descendants would be a sacrilegious act. Since the Phoenicians were unwilling to participate, the rest of the fleet was not strong enough to fight. As a result, the Carthaginians avoided being conquered by the Persians. Cambyses did not force the Phoenicians, as they had willingly surrendered to the Persians, and the fleet relied heavily on their strength. The Cyprians had also voluntarily joined the Persians to help them against Egypt. 
20. When the Fish-eaters arrived from Elephantine in response to Cambyses' call, he sent them to Ethiopia with specific instructions on what to say. They carried gifts, including a red cloak, a twisted gold necklace, bracelets, an alabaster box of incense, and a clay jar of palm wine. The Ethiopians they were sent to are said to be the tallest and most handsome people in the world. Their method of choosing kings is unique, as are all their laws. They believe that the man who is the tallest and has strength matching his height is the most deserving to be their king. 
21. When the Fish-eaters arrived among the Ethiopians, they presented the gifts to their king and said, "Cambyses, the king of the Persians, wants to be your friend and ally. He sent us to speak with you and offers these gifts that he himself enjoys using." However, the Ethiopian king realized they had come as spies and responded, "The Persian king doesn't truly value my friendship, nor are you telling the truth, as you have come to spy on my kingdom. That man is not just; if he were, he wouldn't desire another's land or try to enslave people who have done him no harm. Now, give him this bow and this message: 'The King of the Ethiopians advises the King of the Persians to only attack the long-lived Ethiopians with overwhelming force when the Persians can easily draw a bow of this length as I do. Until then, be grateful to the gods who don't encourage the Ethiopians to conquer more lands.'" 
22. The Ethiopian king spoke and handed the bow to the visitors. He then picked up the red cloak and asked what it was and how it was made. When the Fish-eaters explained the color and dyeing process, the king said that both the people and their clothes were full of deceit. He then asked about the twisted gold necklace and bracelets. When the Fish-eaters explained how they were made, the king smiled, thinking they were chains, and said, "We have stronger chains than these." Next, he inquired about the incense and, after hearing about its production and use, he gave the same response as he did for the cloak. When the king asked about the wine and its production, he was delighted with the drink and asked what kind of food their king ate and the longest age a Persian could live. The Fish-eaters told him their king ate bread, showing him how wheat grew, and said that a person could hope to live up to eighty years. The Ethiopian king then remarked that it was no wonder they lived such short lives if they ate "dung." He added that they wouldn't even be able to live that long if it weren't for the wine, which he thought was excellent. In this aspect, he said, the Persians surpassed the Ethiopians. 
23. The Fish-eaters then asked the Ethiopian king about their lifespan and diet. He said that most of them lived up to a hundred and twenty years, and some even longer. Their food consisted of boiled meat and their drink was milk. The spies were amazed at the long lifespans, so the king took them to a spring. It is said that when they washed in the spring, their skin became smoother, as if they had used oil, and the water smelled like violets. The spies mentioned that the water was so light that nothing would float on it, not even wood or anything lighter; everything sank to the bottom. It is likely that the regular use of this water contributed to the people's long lives. After leaving the spring, the king took them to a prison where all the prisoners were bound with golden chains. In Ethiopia, bronze was considered very rare and valuable. Finally, they were shown the so-called "Table of the Sun." 
24. Finally, the visitors were shown the Ethiopian coffins, which were said to be made of alabaster. The process was as follows: they would shrink the dead body, either in the same way as the Egyptians or using a different method, and then cover it with gypsum. They would paint the gypsum to resemble the person when they were alive as closely as possible. After that, they would place the body inside a hollow alabaster pillar, which was abundant and easy to work with in their land. The body could be seen through the transparent alabaster, without any unpleasant smell or sight, and it appeared as if the person was still alive. For a year, the closest relatives would keep the pillar in their house, offering it the first fruits and performing sacrifices. After the year had passed, they would take the pillars and place them around the city. 
25. After seeing everything, the spies returned and reported their findings. Cambyses became angry and immediately set out to attack the Ethiopians. He didn't prepare any food supplies or consider the long journey ahead. He wasn't thinking clearly and was acting impulsively. Upon hearing the report from the Fish-eaters, he ordered the Greeks who were with him to stay behind while he took his entire land army with him. When he reached Thebes, he sent about fifty thousand men to enslave the Ammonians and burn the oracle of Zeus. He continued towards Ethiopia with the rest of his troops. Before his army had completed even a fifth of their journey, they ran out of provisions. After the food was gone, they ate the pack animals until none were left. If Cambyses had realized the situation and turned back, he would have been wise after making his initial mistake. However, he ignored the problem and kept moving forward. As long as his soldiers could find something to eat from the earth, they survived by eating grass. But when they reached the sandy desert, some resorted to a terrible act: they drew lots and ate one out of every ten men. When Cambyses heard about this, he feared that his soldiers would become cannibals. He decided to abandon his attack on the Ethiopians and returned to Thebes, losing many of his troops along the way. From Thebes, he went down to Memphis and sent the Greeks away by ship. 
26. The expedition against Ethiopia ended in failure. As for the troops sent to attack the Ammonians, they left Thebes with guides and reached the city of Oasis, which was inhabited by Samians believed to be from the Aeschrionian tribe. The journey took seven days across the sandy desert, and the place was known in Greek as the "Islands of the Blest." This was the last known location of the army; after that, no one could provide any information about them, except for the Ammonians and those who heard from them. The soldiers never reached the Ammonians and never returned. According to the Ammonians, when the Persians were crossing the sand from Oasis to attack them and were about halfway between their country and Oasis, a strong and violent south wind arose during their breakfast. This wind carried massive amounts of sand, which buried the soldiers and caused them to vanish from sight. This is the story the Ammonians tell about the fate of that army. 
27. When Cambyses returned to Memphis, a sacred animal called Apis, known as Epaphus to the Greeks, appeared in Egypt. This event prompted the Egyptians to wear their best clothes and celebrate with a festival. Cambyses noticed the Egyptians' joyful behavior and believed they were celebrating his recent misfortunes. He called the rulers of Memphis to question them about the celebrations, asking why the Egyptians were rejoicing now, after he had lost so many of his soldiers, when they hadn't done so during his previous visit to Memphis. The rulers explained that a god, who appeared only after long periods of time, had now revealed himself to the Egyptians, and that the entire country was celebrating this rare event. Cambyses accused them of lying and sentenced them to death for their supposed deception. 
28. After executing the rulers, Cambyses summoned the priests to question them. They provided the same explanation, but he insisted that if a divine creature had indeed come to the Egyptians, he would know about it. He then ordered the priests to bring Apis to him, so they went to fetch the sacred animal. Apis, also known as Epaphus, is a calf born from a cow that can never conceive again. According to the Egyptians, the cow becomes pregnant by a heavenly light and then gives birth to Apis. The calf has distinct markings: it is black with a white, triangular spot on its forehead, an eagle-like shape on its back, double hairs on its tail, and a knot under its tongue. 
29. When the priests brought Apis before him, Cambyses, who was almost mad, pulled out his dagger. He intended to stab the calf in the belly but instead struck its thigh. Laughing, he said to the priests, "Fools, are these your gods? Mere creatures of flesh and blood that can be hurt by iron weapons? Such a god is fitting for the Egyptians. As for you, you'll pay for making a fool of me." He then ordered his men to whip the priests and kill any other Egyptians they found celebrating. The Egyptian festival came to an abrupt end, the priests were punished, and Apis lay in the temple, eventually dying from the thigh wound. After the sacred animal's death, the priests secretly buried him without Cambyses' knowledge. 
30. The Egyptians claim that Cambyses went mad immediately after his wrongful act, although he hadn't been entirely sane even before that. His first evil deed was to kill his own brother, Smerdis, whom he had sent from Egypt to Persia out of jealousy. Smerdis was the only person who could draw the bow brought from Ethiopia by the Fish-eaters as far as two fingerbreadths, while no other Persian could do it. After Smerdis went to Persia, Cambyses had a dream in which a messenger told him that Smerdis, sitting on the royal throne, touched the sky with his head. Fearing that his brother might kill him and become king, Cambyses sent Prexaspes, his most trusted Persian, to Persia to assassinate Smerdis. Prexaspes went to Susa and killed Smerdis. Some say he took Smerdis hunting and killed him there, while others claim he drowned him in the Red Sea. 
31. The Egyptians say that Cambyses' second evil act was to kill his own sister, who had accompanied him to Egypt and whom he had married. Before this, it was not customary for Persians to marry their sisters. However, Cambyses was infatuated with one of his sisters and wanted to marry her. Since his intention went against tradition, he called upon the royal judges to ask if there was any law allowing him to marry his sister. The royal judges were chosen from among the Persians to serve until they died or were found guilty of injustice. They decided legal cases in Persia and interpreted the laws of the land. In response to Cambyses' question, the judges provided a wise and fair answer. They said they could not find any law specifically allowing a brother to marry his sister, but they did find a law permitting the King of Persia to do whatever he pleased. In this way, the judges respected Cambyses' wishes without breaking the law, and they saved themselves from possible execution by finding another law supporting the marriage of siblings. Cambyses married the sister he desired, and not long after, he married another sister as well. It was the younger sister who had come with him to Egypt, and whom he eventually killed. 
32. There are two different stories about the sister's death, just as there are about Smerdis' death. According to the Greek version, Cambyses had arranged a fight between a lion cub and a puppy, which the sister was watching. As the puppy was losing, its brother broke free from its leash and came to help, and together, the two dogs defeated the cub. Cambyses was pleased with the spectacle, but his sister wept. When he asked her why she was crying, she said that seeing the puppy help its brother made her think of Smerdis and how there would be no one to avenge him. For saying this, the Greeks claim, Cambyses killed her. The Egyptian version of the story is different. It says that while the couple was sitting at a table, the sister took a lettuce, removed its leaves, and asked her husband whether he preferred the lettuce with or without leaves. Cambyses replied that he liked it with leaves. She then told him that he had stripped Cyrus' house as bare as the lettuce without leaves. Angered by her words, Cambyses attacked her. She was pregnant at the time, and due to the assault, she miscarried and died from her injuries. 
33. Cambyses committed these terrible acts against his own family, either because of the influence of Apis or due to the many problems that often plague people. In fact, it is said that he suffered from a severe illness since birth, which some refer to as "sacred." Therefore, it is not surprising that when his body was in great pain, his mind would also be affected and unstable. 
34. Cambyses' irrational behavior extended to the rest of Persia as well. He once asked Prexaspes, a man he greatly respected and who served as his messenger, what the Persians thought of him and how they spoke about him. Prexaspes replied, "Sire, the Persians praise you in many ways, but they say that you are too fond of wine." Cambyses became angry and said, "If the Persians think that my love for wine drives me to madness, then their previous statement must also be a lie." It is said that earlier, while some Persians and Croesus were sitting with Cambyses, he asked them how they thought he compared to his father, Cyrus. The Persians responded that Cambyses was the better man because he had all of Cyrus' possessions and had also conquered Egypt and the sea. However, Croesus, who was present and disagreed with their judgment, told Cambyses, "To me, son of Cyrus, you do not seem to be the equal of your father, for you have not yet had a son like the one he left behind in you." Cambyses was pleased with Croesus' opinion and praised his judgment. 
35. Recalling the previous conversation, Cambyses angrily said to Prexaspes, "Let's see if the Persians are telling the truth or if they are the ones who are out of their minds when they talk about me. Your son is standing over there; if I shoot an arrow and hit his heart, it will prove that the Persians are wrong. If I miss, then they are right, and I am not in my right mind." After saying this, he shot the arrow, which struck the boy. He then ordered the body to be opened and the wound examined. When the arrow was found in the boy's heart, Cambyses laughed and said to Prexaspes, "It's clear that I am in my right mind and the Persians are the ones who are mad. Tell me, have you ever seen anyone shoot so accurately?" Prexaspes, realizing that Cambyses was indeed mad and fearing for his own life, replied, "Master, I believe that not even a god could shoot so accurately." That was one of Cambyses' actions. On another occasion, he took twelve Persians, who were among the noblest in the land, accused them of minor offenses, and buried them alive up to their necks. 
36. Croesus, the Lydian, felt it was necessary to confront Cambyses about his actions. He said, "Sire, don't let your youth and temper control you. Be prudent and think ahead. You are killing your own people for minor offenses and even killing boys. If you continue this way, the Persians may revolt against you. Your father, Cyrus, asked me to advise you and offer my guidance." Croesus spoke out of goodwill, but Cambyses replied, "How dare you advise me, after you mismanaged your own country and gave poor advice to my father? You'll pay for this." Cambyses then tried to shoot Croesus with his bow, but Croesus escaped. Cambyses ordered his attendants to catch and kill him. However, they hid Croesus, planning to reveal him later if Cambyses changed his mind, or kill him if he didn't. Soon after, Cambyses wanted Croesus back, and the attendants told him that Croesus was still alive. Cambyses was glad, but he decided that the attendants who saved Croesus should not go unpunished and ordered them to be killed. 
37. Cambyses often acted irrationally towards the Persians and his allies. While in Memphis, he opened ancient coffins to examine the dead bodies inside. He also entered the temple of Hephaestus, where he mocked the statue there. This statue resembled the Phoenician Pataici, which are small figures placed on the front of their ships. They look like dwarfs. Cambyses also went into the temple of the Cabeiri, a place where only the priest is allowed to enter. He burned the statues inside, making fun of them as he did so. These statues were also similar to the image of Hephaestus and were believed to be his sons. 
38. It is clear that Cambyses must have been insane, as he mocked religion and customs. If people from different nations were asked to choose the best customs, each would believe their own to be the best. It is unlikely that anyone other than a madman would ridicule such beliefs. Here is an example that shows how strongly people hold onto their customs: When Darius was king, he asked the Greeks in his presence how much they would need to be paid to eat their deceased fathers' bodies. They replied that no amount of money would make them do it. Then, Darius asked the Callatiae Indians, who practiced eating their parents, how much they would need to be paid to burn their fathers' bodies after death. The Indians were horrified by the suggestion and asked Darius not to speak of such a terrible act. This shows how deeply rooted these beliefs are, and as the poet Pindar said, custom is the ruler of all. 
39. While Cambyses was attacking Egypt, the Lacedaemonians were at war with Samos, led by Polycrates, the son of Aeaces. Polycrates had taken control of Samos by dividing the city into three parts and sharing the government with his brothers, Pantagnotus and Syloson. However, he later killed one brother and banished the other, becoming the sole ruler of Samos. He then formed an alliance with Amasis, the king of Egypt, exchanging gifts with him. Polycrates quickly gained power and became well-known in Ionia and other Greek regions due to his military successes. He had 150 ships and a thousand archers, and he raided various places without discrimination. He believed that returning stolen goods to a friend would earn him more gratitude than not taking them in the first place. He conquered many islands and mainland cities, including defeating the Lesbians who had come to help the Milesians. As his captives, the Lesbians were forced to dig a trench around the acropolis of Samos. 
40. Amasis was aware of Polycrates' great fortune, and as it continued to grow, he sent a letter to Samos saying, "Amasis wishes his friend and ally well. However, I am concerned about your great successes, as I know the gods can be jealous. I would prefer that both I and those I care for have a mix of successes and failures in life, rather than constant success. I have never heard of anyone who experienced continuous good fortune without eventually facing disaster and destruction. So, if you will listen to my advice, think about what you value most and what you would be most upset to lose, and then get rid of it so that it will never be seen again. After doing this, if your successes are not balanced with misfortunes, try to fix the situation as I have suggested." 
41. After reading the letter, Polycrates realized that Amasis' advice was wise. He thought about which of his possessions he would be most saddened to lose and decided on a seal ring with an emerald set in gold, made by Theodorus, the son of Telecles of Samos. Determined to get rid of it, he boarded a fifty-oared ship with its crew and asked them to sail out to sea. Once they were far from the island, he removed the seal ring in front of everyone on the ship and threw it into the sea. After this, he returned home and mourned the loss of his precious ring. 
42. A few days after Polycrates threw his ring into the sea, a fisherman caught a large, beautiful fish and decided to give it as a gift to Polycrates. He went to the king's door and asked to see him. When he was allowed in, the fisherman presented the fish, saying, "My king, when I caught this fish, I didn't want to sell it at the market, even though I make my living that way. Instead, I thought it was worthy of you and your greatness, so I bring it to you as a gift." Polycrates was pleased with the fisherman's words and replied, "You have done very well, and I thank you twice - for your kind words and for the gift. I also invite you to dine with me." The fisherman, proud of the honor, went home. Meanwhile, the servants who were preparing the fish found Polycrates' seal ring inside its belly. They quickly took the ring to Polycrates, happily telling him how they had found it. Polycrates realized that this was a sign from the gods. He wrote a letter to Amasis in Egypt, explaining everything that had happened and how he had found the ring. 
43. After reading Polycrates' letter, Amasis understood that no one could change another person's fate. He realized that Polycrates' constant good fortune, even finding what he had thrown away, would eventually lead to a tragic end. To protect himself from future sorrow, Amasis decided to end their friendship. He sent a messenger to Samos to inform Polycrates of his decision, so that when disaster eventually struck Polycrates, Amasis wouldn't have to grieve for a friend. 
44. The Lacedaemonians went to war against the always-successful Polycrates, encouraged by the Samians who later founded Cydonia in Crete. Without his people's knowledge, Polycrates sent a messenger to Cambyses, son of Cyrus, who was gathering an army to attack Egypt. He invited Cambyses to also request soldiers from Samos. Cambyses eagerly sent a message to Samos, asking Polycrates to provide a fleet to help him against Egypt. Polycrates selected the men he suspected of plotting a rebellion against him and sent them in forty triremes, instructing Cambyses not to send them back. 
45. Some people say that the Samians who were sent never actually reached Egypt. Instead, they discussed the situation among themselves near Carpathus and decided not to sail any further. Others claim that they did arrive in Egypt but managed to escape from the guards watching over them. On their way back to Samos, they encountered Polycrates' ships and fought against them. The returning Samians won the sea battle and landed on the island, but they were defeated in a land battle. After this, they sailed to Lacedaemon for help. There are some who believe that the Samians from Egypt were able to defeat Polycrates, but I don't think this is true. If they could have defeated him on their own, they wouldn't have needed to ask the Lacedaemonians for help. It's also unlikely that Polycrates, who had a large army of hired soldiers and archers, would be defeated by just a few returning Samians. Polycrates took the children and wives of his subjects and locked them up in boathouses, planning to burn them and the boathouses if their men decided to join the returned Samians. 
46. When the Samians who were forced out by Polycrates arrived in Sparta, they spoke to the leaders and gave a long speech to explain their desperate situation. However, the Spartans responded that they had forgotten the beginning of the speech and couldn't understand the end.  The Samians tried again, this time bringing a sack with them. They simply said, "The sack needs flour." The Spartans replied that even mentioning "the sack" was too many words, but they agreed to help the Samians. 
47. The Lacedaemonians prepared and sent an army to Samos to help the Samians. The Samians believed this was to repay a favor, as they had previously sent a fleet to assist the Lacedaemonians against Messenia. However, the Lacedaemonians claimed that their main reason for sending the army was to get revenge for the theft of a bowl they were taking to Croesus and a breastplate that King Amasis of Egypt had gifted them. The Samians had stolen the breastplate a year before they took the bowl. The breastplate was made of linen, adorned with gold and cotton embroidery, and featured many intricate designs. What made it truly remarkable was that each fine thread of the breastplate was composed of 360 strands, all clearly visible. This breastplate was almost identical to another one that Amasis had dedicated to Athena in Lindus. 
48. The Corinthians were eager to support the mission against Samos because they had been wronged by the Samians a generation earlier, around the time the bowl was stolen. Periander, the son of Cypselus, had sent 300 boys from prominent Corcyra families to Alyattes in Sardis to be made eunuchs. The Corinthians who were transporting the boys stopped in Samos, and when the Samians learned the reason for the boys' journey, they helped them seek refuge in the temple of Artemis. The Samians refused to let the boys be taken from the temple, even when the Corinthians tried to starve them out. In response, the Samians held a festival that they still celebrate today. During this festival, young men and women would dance at night, and it became a tradition to bring cakes made of sesame and honey so that the Corcyraean boys could steal them for food. This continued until the Corinthian guards eventually gave up and left. Afterward, the Samians returned the boys safely to Corcyra. 
49. If the Corinthians had been friendly with the Corcyraeans after Periander's death, they wouldn't have joined the mission against Samos for this reason. However, despite their kinship, the two groups had been in conflict ever since the island was colonized. This is why the Corinthians held a grudge against the Samians. Periander had sent the sons of prominent Corcyraeans to Sardis to be made eunuchs as an act of revenge, because the Corcyraeans had started the conflict by committing a terrible crime against him. 
50. After Periander killed his wife Melissa, he faced another tragedy on top of his existing troubles. He had two sons with Melissa, one aged seventeen and the other eighteen. Their maternal grandfather, Procles, the ruler of Epidaurus, invited the boys over and treated them with love, as they were his daughter's children. When they were leaving, he asked them, "Do you know who killed your mother?" The older son didn't pay attention to these words, but the younger one, named Lycophron, was so horrified by what he heard that when he returned to Corinth, he refused to speak to his father, who had killed his mother. He wouldn't respond to his father's questions or acknowledge him when spoken to. Eventually, Periander became so angry that he kicked the boy out of the house. 
51. After sending the younger son away, Periander asked the older son about their conversation with their grandfather. The boy mentioned that Procles had treated them kindly but didn't mention what he had said when they were leaving, as he hadn't paid attention. Periander insisted that Procles must have said something, and after persistent questioning, the boy finally remembered and told him. Understanding the situation and not wanting to appear weak, Periander sent a message to the people who were hosting his banished son, telling them not to keep him. As a result, the boy was forced to leave and find another place to stay. However, he was also driven out of the new house, as Periander threatened anyone who took him in and ordered them to turn him away. Despite being Periander's son and the fear it caused, the boy's friends still took him in whenever he was forced to leave another home. 
52. Eventually, Periander announced that anyone who sheltered his son or spoke to him would have to pay a fine to Apollo, and he set the amount. Because of this, no one wanted to talk to the boy or let him stay in their house. The boy also didn't think it was right to do what was forbidden, so he accepted his fate and slept outside. After four days, seeing his son starving and dirty, Periander felt sorry for him and his anger softened. He approached his son and said, "My son, which is better - to continue living like this or to be on good terms with your father and inherit my power and wealth? Even though you're my son and a prince of prosperous Corinth, you choose to live like a homeless person by opposing and being angry with me, the person you should be least angry with. If something happened that made you suspicious of me, it has hurt me more than anyone else, as I am the cause. Remember that it's better to be envied than pitied, and think about how wrong it is to be angry with your parents and those who are stronger than you. Come back home." Periander tried to persuade his son with these words, but the boy didn't say anything else to his father, only reminding him that since they had talked, he now owed the fine to Apollo. Seeing that his son's stubbornness couldn't be changed or overcome, Periander sent him away on a ship to Corcyra, a place under his control. After sending his son away, he sent an army against his father-in-law, Procles, who he blamed for his current problems. He conquered Epidaurus, captured Procles, and imprisoned him. 
53. As time passed, Periander grew older and realized he could no longer manage all his affairs. He decided to invite his son Lycophron to become the ruler of Corcyra, as he didn't see any potential in his eldest son, who seemed slow-witted. Lycophron, however, didn't respond to the invitation. Periander then sent his daughter, Lycophron's sister, to persuade him, thinking that he might listen to her. She told her brother, "Don't let our father's power fall into the hands of others and his house be destroyed. Come home, stop punishing yourself, and take what is rightfully yours. Pride is a terrible thing to have. Don't try to fix one wrong with another. Many people choose what looks good over what is right, and many have lost their father's inheritance while pursuing their mother's affairs. Power is hard to hold onto, and many people want it. Our father is old and past his prime, so don't let others take what belongs to you." Despite her efforts, Lycophron replied that he would never return to Corinth as long as his father was alive. When she reported this back to Periander, he sent another messenger with a new proposal: he would go to Corcyra, and Lycophron could return to Corinth and inherit his power. The son agreed to this arrangement, and they both prepared to switch places. However, when the people of Corcyra learned about these plans, they killed Lycophron to prevent Periander from coming to their country. This is why Periander sought revenge against the Corcyraeans. 
54. The Lacedaemonians arrived with a large army and began to attack Samos. They managed to get through the wall and enter a tower by the sea, located on the outer part of the city. However, Polycrates and his forces fought back, driving the Lacedaemonians out of the tower. Some mercenaries and Samians tried to hold off the Lacedaemonians near an upper tower on a hill, but they were only able to resist for a short time before retreating. The Lacedaemonians chased after them, causing great destruction. 
55. If all the Lacedaemonians had fought like Archias and Lycopas that day, they would have captured Samos. These two warriors were the only ones who managed to enter the fortress along with the retreating Samians, but they were trapped and killed inside the city of Samos. I once met another Archias in his hometown of Pitana, who was the son of Samius and the grandson of the Archias mentioned earlier. He told me that he respected the Samians more than any of his other friends because they had given his grandfather a public funeral. He also mentioned that his father was named Samius in honor of the brave Archias who had died fighting in Samos. 
56. After unsuccessfully besieging Samos for forty days, the Lacedaemonians left and returned to the Peloponnesus. There's a silly story that Polycrates bribed them to leave by giving them a large number of lead coins covered in gold, pretending it was local currency. This was the first time the Dorian Lacedaemonians had launched an expedition to Asia. 
57. As the Lacedaemonians were leaving, the Samians who had fought against Polycrates also sailed away and went to Siphnus. They needed money, and the Siphnians were very wealthy at that time due to the gold and silver mines on their island. They were so rich that they dedicated a treasure at Delphi, made from a tenth of their income, which was as valuable as any other treasure there. They also shared their yearly income among themselves. When they were preparing the treasure, they asked the oracle if their prosperity would last. The priestess gave them a cryptic response, saying that when the town hall and market of Siphnus turned white, they would need a clever person to help them. They should also be cautious of a wooden force and a red messenger. At that time, the town hall and market of Siphnus were decorated with beautiful white Parian marble. 
58. The people couldn't understand the oracle's message when it was first spoken or when the Samians arrived. As the Samians reached Siphnus, they sent ambassadors to the town on one of their ships, which were traditionally painted with red vermilion. This was the warning the priestess had given to the Siphnians about a wooden force and a red messenger. The ambassadors asked the Siphnians for a loan of ten talents, but they refused. In response, the Samians started to attack their lands. When the Siphnians heard about this, they tried to drive the Samians away but were defeated in battle. Many Siphnians were cut off from their town by the Samians, who then demanded a hundred talents from them. 
59. The Samians took the island of Hydrea from the people of Hermione, instead of money, which is close to the Peloponnesus. They entrusted the island to the people of Troezen for protection. The Samians then settled in Cydonia, Crete, even though their original plan was to drive the Zacynthians out of the island. They lived and thrived there for five years, building temples and the shrine of Dictyna in Cydonia. However, in the sixth year, the Aeginetans and Cretans defeated the Samians in a sea battle and enslaved them. They also cut off the ships' prows, which were shaped like boars' heads, and dedicated them to the temple of Athena in Aegina. The Aeginetans did this because they held a grudge against the Samians. In the past, when Amphicrates was the king of Samos, the Samians had attacked Aegina and both sides had suffered losses. This was the reason for their animosity. 
60. I've written extensively about the Samians because they were responsible for three of the greatest achievements among the Greeks. The first one is a tunnel with entrances at both ends, going through the base of a 900-foot hill. The entire tunnel is 4,200 feet long, 8 feet high, and 8 feet wide. Along its length, there's a 30-foot deep and 3-foot wide channel that carries water from a large spring to the city of Samos through pipes. Eupalinus, son of Naustrophus, a Megarian, designed this impressive work. The second achievement is a breakwater in the sea that surrounds the harbor. It's 120 feet deep and over 1,200 feet long. The third remarkable work by the Samians is the temple, which is the largest of all known temples. Rhoecus, son of Philes, a Samian, was its first builder. It's because of these extraordinary accomplishments that I've provided a detailed account of Samos. 
61. After Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, lost his mind while in Egypt, two Magus brothers rebelled against him. One of them had been appointed by Cambyses as the steward of his house. This man realized that the death of Smerdis was a secret, with only a few people knowing about it and most believing he was still alive. So, he decided to seize the royal power. He had a brother who looked very similar to Cyrus' son Smerdis, who had been killed by his own brother, Cambyses. This brother not only resembled him in appearance but also had the same name, Smerdis. Patizeithes, the Magus, convinced this man that he would handle everything for him. He brought his brother to the royal throne and sent messengers to all regions, including one to Egypt, to announce to the army that they must now obey Smerdis, the son of Cyrus, instead of Cambyses. 
62. The proclamation was announced everywhere. The messenger assigned to go to Egypt found Cambyses and his army in Ecbatana, Syria, and delivered the message in front of everyone. When Cambyses heard it, he thought it was true and believed that Prexaspes had not killed Smerdis as instructed, but had betrayed him instead. Cambyses looked at Prexaspes and asked, "Is this how you carried out my orders?" Prexaspes replied, "No, sire, it's not true that your brother Smerdis has rebelled against you. He can't have any issues with you, big or small, because I did as you instructed and buried him with my own hands. If the dead can come back to life, then you should expect to see Astyages the Mede rise against you. But if things remain as they are, you won't face any harm from Smerdis. In my opinion, we should chase this messenger and question him to find out who sent him with the message that we must obey Smerdis as our king." 
63. Cambyses appreciated Prexaspes' suggestion, and the messenger was immediately caught and brought back. Prexaspes then asked the messenger, "You claim your message is from Cyrus' son Smerdis. Tell me, did Smerdis himself give you this order, or was it one of his servants? If you answer truthfully, you won't be punished." The messenger replied, "Ever since King Cambyses left for Egypt, I haven't seen Smerdis, the son of Cyrus. The Magus, whom Cambyses put in charge of his house, gave me the message, saying it was Smerdis, son of Cyrus, who wanted me to inform you." The messenger told the whole truth, and Cambyses said, "Prexaspes, you did as you were told and are not to blame. But who is this Persian who rebels against me and uses the name of Smerdis?" Prexaspes responded, "I think I understand what has happened here, sire. The rebels are the Magi, Patizeithes, whom you left in charge of your house, and his brother Smerdis." 
64. When Cambyses heard the name Smerdis, the truth of the words and a dream he had struck him. In his dream, he saw Smerdis sitting on the royal throne, touching the sky with his head. Realizing that he had killed his brother for no reason, Cambyses cried bitterly for Smerdis. Overwhelmed by his misfortune, he decided to ride his horse to Susa to confront the Magus. As he got on his horse, the cap of his sword's sheath fell off, and the exposed blade pierced his thigh. The wound was in the same spot where he had once injured the Egyptian god Apis. Believing the wound to be fatal, Cambyses asked the name of the town where he was. They told him it was Ecbatana. He had previously received a prophecy from Buto that he would die in Ecbatana. Cambyses thought this meant he would die of old age in the Median Ecbatana, his capital city. However, the prophecy actually referred to his death in Ecbatana of Syria. When he learned the name of the town, the shock of his wound and the misfortune caused by the Magus made him realize the truth of the prophecy. He said, "Here, Cambyses, son of Cyrus, is to die." 
65. At that time, Cambyses didn't say anything more. About twenty days later, he called the most important Persians around him and told them, "Persians, I have something to reveal that I've kept hidden. When I was in Egypt, I had a dream I wish I hadn't had. It seemed a messenger came to tell me that Smerdis, sitting on the royal throne, touched the sky with his head. Fearing my brother would take my power, I acted hastily and without wisdom. We can't escape our fate, but I was blind and sent Prexaspes to Susa to kill Smerdis. After that terrible deed, I lived without fear, never thinking that someone else might rise against me once Smerdis was gone. But I misunderstood my fate; I killed my brother when there was no need, and I still lost my kingdom. The dream had warned me about the Magus Smerdis revolting, not my brother. Now, my brother is dead because of me, and I want you to know that Smerdis, the son of Cyrus, is no longer alive. The Magi rule the kingdom, the one I left in charge of my house and his brother Smerdis. So, the man who should have avenged me for the disgrace I suffered from the Magi is dead because of his terrible fate at the hands of his own family. Since he's no longer alive, I must ask you, Persians, to fulfill my last wish. I urge all of you, especially the Achaemenids here, not to let the kingdom fall back into Median hands. If they took it through trickery, take it back with your own tricks. If they took it by force, take it back with even greater force. If you do this, may your land be fruitful, and your women, flocks, and herds be blessed with offspring, remaining free forever. But if you don't take back the kingdom or try to, I pray that the opposite happens to you, and that every Persian meets an end like mine." With that, Cambyses cried bitterly for everything that had happened to him. 
66. When the Persians saw their king crying, they all tore their clothes and wailed loudly for a long time. Later, as the bone in Cambyses' leg rotted and his thigh quickly decayed, he died. Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, had ruled for a total of seven years and five months but had no children, neither boys nor girls. The Persians who were present couldn't believe that the Magi had taken control of the kingdom. They thought Cambyses was trying to trick them with his story about Smerdis' death, so that all of Persia would end up fighting against him. 
67. The people believed that Smerdis, the son of Cyrus, had become king. Prexaspes strongly denied killing Smerdis because, with Cambyses dead, it wasn't safe for him to admit that he had killed Cyrus' son with his own hands. After Cambyses' death, the Magus pretended to be Smerdis, the son of Cyrus, and ruled without fear for the remaining seven months of what would have been Cambyses' eight-year reign. During this time, he did so much good for his subjects that after his death, all the people in Asia, except the Persians, wished he could return. He sent messages to every nation he ruled, announcing a three-year break from military service and taxes. 
68. At the beginning of his reign, the Magus made a proclamation. However, in the eighth month, his true identity was discovered. A man named Otanes, the son of Pharnaspes, was a wealthy and well-born Persian. He was the first to suspect that the Magus was not Smerdis, the son of Cyrus, because the Magus never left the acropolis or met with any important Persians. With this suspicion, Otanes took action. Cambyses had married Otanes' daughter, Phaedyme, and the Magus was now living with her and all of Cambyses' other wives. Otanes sent a message to Phaedyme, asking if she was with Smerdis, the son of Cyrus, or someone else. She replied that she didn't know, as she had never seen Smerdis and didn't know who she was living with. Otanes then sent another message, suggesting that she ask Atossa, as she would surely know her own brother. Phaedyme responded that she couldn't communicate with Atossa or any other women in the household because the Magus, whoever he was, had separated them all to live in different places as soon as he became king. 
69. When Otanes received this information, he understood the situation better. He sent a third message to his daughter: "Your noble birth requires you to take any risk that your father asks of you. If this man is not Smerdis, the son of Cyrus, but the person I suspect, he must not be allowed to sleep with you and rule Persia without punishment. When he is asleep next to you, feel his ears. If he has ears, you can be sure that he is Smerdis, the son of Cyrus. If he doesn't, then he is Smerdis the Magus." Phaedyme replied that she would be taking a great risk, as he might kill her if he caught her feeling for his ears and discovered he had none. However, she agreed to do it for her father. During his reign, Cyrus, the son of Cambyses, had cut off the ears of this Magus Smerdis for a serious reason. Phaedyme, Otanes' daughter, kept her promise to her father. When it was her turn to be with the Magus (as the Persians took turns with their wives), she went to his bed and felt for his ears while he was in a deep sleep. She easily confirmed that he had no ears and informed her father the next morning. 
70. Otanes decided to share the whole story with two highly respected Persians whom he trusted, Aspathines and Gobryas. It seemed that they had already suspected the truth, and they easily believed what Otanes told them. They agreed that each of them should involve another trusted Persian. Otanes brought in Intaphrenes, Gobryas brought Megabyzus, and Aspathines brought Hydarnes. When they were a group of six, Darius arrived in Susa. His father, Hystaspes, was a lower-ranking governor of the Persians. Upon his arrival, the six Persians decided to include Darius in their plans as well. 
71. The seven men gathered, exchanged tokens of trust, and discussed their plans. When it was Darius' turn to speak, he said, "I thought I was the only one who knew that the Magus was the king and that Smerdis, the son of Cyrus, was dead. That's why I came here quickly, to bring about the Magus' downfall. But since you all know this too, I think we should act immediately and not delay." Otanes responded, "Son of Hystaspes, you have a good father, and you seem to be just as capable as him. However, don't rush into this without careful thought; we need more people to succeed." Darius replied, "Gentlemen, if you follow Otanes' advice, know that you will face a terrible fate. Someone will inform the Magus, hoping to gain wealth for themselves. You should have done this on your own, but since you decided to involve others, including me, we must act today. Otherwise, if we let today pass, I will be the one to betray you to the Magus before anyone else does." 
72. Seeing Darius' determination, Otanes replied, "Since you insist on acting quickly and won't allow any delay, tell us how we can enter the palace and confront them. You must know that there are guards stationed all around. How can we get past them?" Darius answered, "Otanes, some things can't be explained in words but must be done through actions. Other things can be described in words, but they don't lead to great outcomes. You know that it's easy to bypass the guards. They will let us pass out of respect or fear, given who we are. Moreover, I have the perfect excuse to enter: I'll say that I just arrived from Persia and have a message for the king from my father. When lying is necessary, lie. Both liars and truth-tellers want the same thing: to gain trust and advantage. Some lie to achieve this, while others tell the truth to gain trust and benefit. We pursue the same goals through different means. If there were no hope of gaining something, the truth-teller would be just as willing to lie as the liar would be to tell the truth. If any of the guards let us pass willingly, it will be better for them later. But if any of them try to stop us, we should consider them enemies, push our way in, and start our mission." 
73. Gobryas then said, "Friends, when will we have a better opportunity to reclaim the kingship or, if we can't, to die? We, the Persians, are being ruled by a Mede, a Magus, and a man without ears. Those of you who were with Cambyses when he died must remember the curse he placed on the Persians if they didn't try to regain the kingship. At that time, we didn't believe Cambyses and thought he was trying to deceive us. Now, I believe we should follow Darius' plan and not leave this meeting to do anything else but attack the Magus immediately." Gobryas' words were met with agreement from everyone present. 
74. As they were making these plans, a coincidental event occurred. The Magi decided to befriend Prexaspes, as he had been wronged by Cambyses (who killed his son with an arrow) and was the only one who knew about the death of Cyrus' son Smerdis, as he was the one who killed him. Additionally, Prexaspes was highly respected among the Persians. For these reasons, the Magi summoned him and tried to gain his friendship. They made him promise to keep their deception a secret and not reveal it to anyone, assuring him that he would be rewarded with great abundance. Prexaspes agreed to their request since the Magi insisted. The Magi then made a second proposal to Prexaspes. They asked him to gather all the Persians in front of the palace wall, climb a tower, and announce that it was Smerdis, the son of Cyrus, who was the king of Persia and not someone else. They entrusted him with this task because they believed he was the most trusted man among the Persians, and he had previously claimed that Cyrus' son Smerdis was alive and denied his murder. 
75. When Prexaspes agreed to do this as well, the Magi gathered the Persians and brought him up to a tower, instructing him to speak. However, Prexaspes intentionally ignored the Magi's instructions. He began by recounting the lineage of Cyrus from Achaemenes onwards. When he reached the name of Cyrus, he described all the good that the king had done for Persia. After narrating this, he revealed the truth, explaining that he had kept it hidden before because it wasn't safe for him to disclose what had happened. But now, he felt compelled to reveal it. He confessed that he had killed Smerdis, the son of Cyrus, under Cambyses' orders, and that the Magi were now in power. Then, he called upon a terrible curse on the Persians if they didn't reclaim the throne and take revenge on the Magi. After saying this, he threw himself headfirst from the tower, resulting in his death. Prexaspes, a man who had always been well-regarded, met his end in this manner. 
76. The seven Persians, having decided to attack the Magi immediately without delay, prayed to the gods and set off, unaware of what had happened to Prexaspes. As they reached the halfway point, they learned about Prexaspes' fate. They stopped by the road and began to argue. Otanes' group insisted that they should wait and not attack while the situation was still uncertain, while Darius' group argued that they should proceed with their plan without delay. As they were arguing, they saw seven pairs of hawks chasing, attacking, and tearing apart two pairs of vultures. Witnessing this, all seven Persians agreed with Darius' opinion and continued towards the palace, feeling encouraged by the sight of the birds. 
77. When they arrived at the gate, things happened as Darius had predicted. The guards, out of respect for the prominent Persians and not suspecting any trouble from them, allowed them to pass without questioning, as if they were guided by divine intervention. As they entered the court, they encountered the eunuchs who were responsible for delivering messages. The eunuchs asked the seven Persians why they had come and scolded the watchmen for letting them through, while trying to stop the seven from proceeding further. The seven Persians exchanged a signal, drew their knives, and stabbed the eunuchs who were blocking their way. Then, they rushed towards the men's quarters. 
78. Both Magi were inside, discussing the consequences of Prexaspes' actions. When they saw the eunuchs in chaos and heard their screams, they both jumped up. Realizing what was happening, they prepared to defend themselves. One of them grabbed a bow, while the other reached for a spear. The fight began. The Magus with the bow found it useless since the enemies were too close and fighting in close quarters. However, the other Magus defended himself with his spear, injuring Aspathines in the thigh and Intaphrenes in the eye. Intaphrenes lost his eye due to the injury but survived. The other Magus, unable to use his bow, fled into a nearby room and tried to close the door. Two of the seven Persians, Darius and Gobryas, followed him into the room. Gobryas and the Magus began wrestling, while Darius stood in the dark, unsure of what to do, fearing he might accidentally stab Gobryas. Gobryas noticed Darius' hesitation and asked why he wasn't helping. Darius replied, "I'm afraid I might stab you." Gobryas responded, "Use your sword, even if it goes through both of us." Darius followed his advice, stabbed with his knife, and managed to hit the Magus. 
79. After killing the Magi and cutting off their heads, the seven Persians left their wounded companions behind due to their injuries and to guard the fortress. Five of them, carrying the Magi's heads, ran outside, shouting loudly and calling for help from other Persians. They shared their story, showed the heads, and killed any Magus they encountered along the way. When the Persians learned about the actions of the seven and how the Magi had deceived them, they decided to follow suit. They drew their daggers and killed as many Magi as they could find. If it hadn't been for nightfall, they would not have left a single Magus alive. This day became the most important holiday for all Persians, who celebrate a grand festival called the Massacre of the Magi. During the festival, no Magus is allowed to go outside, and they must stay in their homes. 
80. After the chaos had settled and five days had passed, the rebels who fought against the Magi held a meeting to discuss the current situation. Some of the opinions expressed during the meeting might seem unbelievable to some Greeks, but there is no doubt that they were indeed spoken. Otanes suggested that the government should be handed over to the Persian people. He said, "I believe that having a single ruler over us is no longer acceptable or beneficial. We have witnessed the arrogance of Cambyses and experienced the tyranny of the Magus. How can a monarchy be suitable when the ruler can act without consequences? Even if you give this power to the best person on earth, it would lead them to develop new, harmful thoughts. The abundance of good things at their disposal creates arrogance, while envy is a natural human trait. Possessing both, a person embodies complete evil. They indulge in reckless actions, some driven by arrogance and others by envy. An absolute ruler should be free from envy, having access to all good things, but they often become the opposite, envying the best of their citizens who thrive and live, while taking pleasure in the misfortune of others. They are also the best breeding ground for gossip. A ruler is the most contradictory of all people; if you admire them modestly, they get angry for not receiving excessive attention, but if you give them excessive attention, they get angry for being flattered. I have even worse things to say about them; they disrupt traditional customs, violate women, and kill indiscriminately. On the other hand, the rule of the masses has the most beautiful name of all - equality - and does not commit the same wrongs as a monarch. It assigns positions by drawing lots, holds power accountable, and conducts all discussions publicly. Therefore, I believe that we should put an end to monarchy and elevate the masses, as the majority can achieve anything." 
81. Otanes argued for democracy, but Megabyzus suggested that they should adopt an oligarchy instead. He said, "I agree with Otanes' points against having a single ruler, but when he proposes giving power to the masses, his judgment deviates from what's best. There's nothing more foolish and chaotic than an aimless crowd. It's not acceptable for people to escape the tyranny of one ruler only to fall victim to the chaos of an uncontrolled public. A single ruler makes decisions with knowledge, while the masses lack it. How can they have knowledge if they haven't learned or seen for themselves what's best? They always rush forward and act blindly, like a river in flood. Those who wish harm to Persia may support democracy, but we should select a group of the best individuals and grant them power. We will be among them, and it's likely that the best decisions will come from the best people." 
82. Megabyzus shared his opinion, and then it was Darius' turn to speak. He said, "In my view, Megabyzus is right about democracy but not about oligarchy. If we assume that the best forms of democracy, oligarchy, and monarchy are being proposed, I believe that monarchy is by far the most excellent. Nothing is better than the rule of the single best person, who, with the best judgment, will govern the masses with perfect wisdom and effectively conceal plans to defeat enemies. In an oligarchy, the desire of many to serve the state well often leads to bitter rivalry among them. Each person wants to be first and have their opinions prevail, resulting in intense hatred, factions, and eventually violence. From this violence, power reverts back to a monarchy, proving that monarchy is indeed superior. When the people rule, it's impossible to avoid wickedness. When wickedness occurs within the state, it doesn't create hatred among the wicked but rather strong alliances. Those who want to harm the state conspire together. This continues until someone from the people rises to stop them. This person then becomes the people's hero and, being their hero, is made their monarch, further proving that monarchy is the best form of government. In summary, let's remember where our freedom came from and who gave it to us - was it the people, an oligarchy, or a single ruler? I believe that since we were liberated by one person, we should maintain that form of government and not change our good ancestral traditions, as that would not be an improvement." 
83. Faced with the three options, four of the seven men favored the last one. Otanes, whose proposal for equality among Persians was defeated, addressed the group, saying, "Friends, it's clear that one of us must become king, whether by drawing lots, being chosen by the Persians, or through some other method. However, I won't compete with you. I don't want to rule or be ruled. If I give up my claim to be king, I ask that neither I nor any of my descendants be subject to any one of you." The other six agreed to Otanes' terms, and he withdrew from the contest. To this day, his family remains the only one in Persia that enjoys freedom, being ruled only to the extent they are willing, as long as they don't break Persian laws. 
84. The remaining seven men discussed the fairest way to choose a king. They decided that if someone other than Otanes became king, Otanes and his descendants would receive a yearly gift of Median clothing and other valuable items, as he was the one who first planned the matter and gathered the conspirators. They chose this specific honor for Otanes, and for all of them, they agreed that any one of the seven could enter the king's palace without announcement, unless the king was with a woman. Additionally, the king would only be allowed to marry someone from the conspirators' families. As for selecting the king, they decided that the person whose horse neighed first at sunrise, while they were all in their saddles in the city's outskirts, would be elected king. 
85. Darius had a clever groom named Oebares. After the council meeting, Darius told him about their decision to choose the king based on whose horse neighed first at sunrise. He asked Oebares if he had any tricks to ensure that they would win. Oebares confidently replied, "Master, if this is what determines whether you become king or not, be sure that no one else will be king before you, as I have some tricks up my sleeve." Darius then urged him to use his trick without delay, as the decision would be made the next day. Upon hearing this, Oebares took action. At nightfall, he brought one of the mares that Darius' horse was particularly fond of and tied her in the city's outskirts. Then, he brought Darius' horse and repeatedly led him near the mare, allowing them to bump against each other. Finally, he let the horse mount the mare. 
86. At daybreak, the six men arrived on horseback as planned. As they rode through the outskirts of the city and reached the spot where the mare had been tied the night before, Darius' horse moved forward and neighed. At that moment, lightning and thunder appeared in the clear sky. These signs, combined with the horse's neigh, were seen as predestined and confirmed Darius' election as king. His companions immediately dismounted their horses and bowed to him. 
87. Some people believe that Oebares had planned the whole event. However, there is another story in Persia about what happened. It is said that Oebares rubbed the mare's private area with his hand and kept his hand hidden inside his clothes. When the six men were about to release their horses at sunrise, Oebares took his hand out and held it close to Darius' horse's nose. The horse immediately snorted and neighed. 
88. Darius, the son of Hystaspes, became king and ruled over all of Asia, which had been conquered by Cyrus and later by Cambyses. The Arabians, however, were not his subjects but rather allies, as they had allowed Cambyses to pass through their land to enter Egypt. The Persians could not enter Egypt without the consent of the Arabians. Darius married women from the most noble families of Persia, including Cyrus' daughters Atossa and Artystone. Atossa had previously been married to her brother Cambyses and then to the Magus, while Artystone was unmarried. Darius also married Parmys, the daughter of Cyrus' son Smerdis, and the daughter of Otanes, who had discovered the truth about the Magus. Darius' power was evident everywhere. He commissioned a carved stone depicting a horseman with an inscription that read: "Darius, son of Hystaspes, with the help of his excellent horse" (the horse's name was included) "and his groom Oebares, gained possession of the kingdom of Persia." 
89. After completing his tasks in Persia, Darius divided his empire into twenty provinces, known as satrapies. He appointed governors for each province and instructed the people to pay him tribute. He grouped neighboring regions together and distributed distant regions among different provinces, ignoring those in between. Next, I will describe how he divided his provinces and the annual tributes he received. Those who paid in silver had to provide the weight of a Babylonian talent, while those who paid in gold had to give a Euboic talent. A Babylonian talent was equal to seventy-eight Euboic minae. During the reigns of Cyrus and Cambyses, there was no fixed tribute; instead, payments were made in the form of gifts. Because of his implementation of fixed tributes and other similar regulations, the Persians referred to Darius as "the merchant," Cambyses as "the master," and Cyrus as "the father." Darius sought to profit from everything, Cambyses was harsh and arrogant, while Cyrus was kind and always worked for the well-being of his people. 
90. The people of Ionia, Magnesia, Aeolia, Caria, Lycia, Milyas, and Pamphylia were grouped together by Darius and required to pay a combined tribute of 400 silver talents. This region was considered his first province. The second province, consisting of Mysia, Lydia, Lasonia, Cabalia, and Hytennia, paid 500 silver talents. The third province included the Hellespontians, Asian Phrygians, Asian Thracians, Paphlagonians, Mariandynians, and Syrians, who together paid 360 silver talents. Cilicia was the fourth province and was required to provide 360 white horses, one for each day of the year, as well as 500 silver talents. Out of these, 140 talents were used to support the horsemen who guarded Cilicia, while the remaining 360 talents were paid to Darius. 
91. The fifth province included the land between Posideion, a city on the border of Cilicia and Syria founded by Amphilochus, and Egypt, excluding the Arabian territory that paid no tribute. This province, which consisted of Phoenicia, part of Syria known as Palestine, and Cyprus, paid 350 silver talents. The sixth province was made up of Egypt, nearby parts of Libya, Cyrene, and Barca. This region contributed 700 silver talents, in addition to revenue from fish in Lake Moeris and a grain tax. The grain, amounting to 120,000 bushels, was provided to the Persians stationed at the White Wall of Memphis and their allies. The seventh province, which included the Sattagydae, Gandarii, Dadicae, and Aparytae, paid a combined tribute of 170 silver talents. The eighth province consisted of Susa and the rest of the Cissian territory, contributing 300 silver talents. 
92. The ninth province, which included Babylon and the rest of Assyria, provided Darius with 1,000 silver talents and 500 castrated boys. The tenth province, consisting of Ecbatana, the rest of Media, the Paricanians, and the Orthocorybantians, paid 450 silver talents. The eleventh province was made up of the Caspii, Pausicae, Pantimathi, and Daritae, who together contributed 200 silver talents. 
93. The twelfth province included the Bactrians and the land up to the Aegli territory, paying 360 silver talents. The thirteenth province consisted of the Pactyic region, Armenia, and neighboring lands up to the Euxine Sea, contributing 400 silver talents. The fourteenth province was made up of the Sagartii, Sarangeis, Thamanaei, Utii, Myci, and the inhabitants of the southern sea islands where the king settled displaced people. Together, they paid 600 silver talents. The fifteenth province included the Sacae and Caspii, who paid 250 silver talents. The sixteenth province was made up of the Parthians, Chorasmians, Sogdi, and Arii, contributing 300 silver talents. 
94. The seventeenth province included the Paricanii and the Asian Ethiopians, who paid 400 silver talents. The eighteenth province was made up of the Matieni, Saspiri, and Alarodii, contributing 200 silver talents. The nineteenth province consisted of the Moschi, Tibareni, Macrones, Mossynoeci, and Mares, who together paid 300 silver talents. The twentieth province was made up of the Indians, who were more numerous than any other nation known to us. They paid the largest tribute of all the provinces, amounting to 360 talents of gold dust. 
95. When the value of the Babylonian silver talents is converted to Euboic currency, the total comes to 9,880 Euboic talents. Since gold is thirteen times more valuable than silver, the gold dust is worth 4,680 Euboic talents. By adding these amounts together, it becomes clear that Darius collected an annual tribute of 14,560 talents. In this calculation, I am not considering any amounts less than ten. 
96. Darius received income from Asia and some parts of Libya. Over time, he also collected tribute from the islands and people living in Europe, up to Thessaly. The king stored the tribute in a unique way: he melted it down and poured it into clay pots. Once the pots were full, he broke the clay away. Whenever he needed money, he would mint coins from the stored metal as required. 
97. The governments and tribute assignments mentioned earlier did not include the Persian country, as the Persians lived free from taxes. Some regions were not required to pay tribute but instead offered gifts. First, there were the Ethiopians near Egypt, who were conquered by Cambyses during his expedition towards the long-lived Ethiopians. There were also those living around the sacred Nysa, where they celebrated the god Dionysus. These Ethiopians and their neighbors, who lived underground and used the same seeds as the Indian Callantiae, brought gifts every two years. These gifts included two measures of unrefined gold, two hundred blocks of ebony, five Ethiopian boys, and twenty large elephant tusks. Gifts were also expected from the Colchians and their neighbors up to the Caucasus mountains, which marked the northern limit of Persian rule. These gifts, which included a hundred boys and a hundred girls, were given every four years and continue to be given. The Arabians offered a thousand talents' weight of frankincense each year. These were the gifts provided to the king by these people, in addition to the tribute. 
98. The Indians obtain a large amount of gold, which they send as gold dust to the king, in the following way. To the east of India, there is a sandy region. Among all the known people of Asia, the Indians live closest to the east and the rising sun. The eastern side of India is mostly uninhabited due to the sand. There are many different Indian tribes, each with their own language. Some of them are nomadic, while others are not. Some live in marshy areas near rivers and survive on raw fish, which they catch using boats made from a single piece of reed. These Indians wear clothes made from bullrushes, a type of plant found near the river. They cut the bullrushes, weave them together like a mat, and wear them as a protective covering on their chests. 
99. There are other Indians, living to the east of the previously mentioned tribes, who are nomadic and eat raw meat. These people are called Padaei. It is believed that when one of their members, whether male or female, becomes sick, their closest friends kill them. They argue that if the person becomes weak from illness, they will lose the opportunity to consume their meat. Even if the sick person denies being unwell, their friends don't believe them and proceed to kill and eat them. Similarly, when a woman falls sick, her female friends carry out the same practice. If someone manages to reach old age, they are sacrificed and their flesh is eaten during a feast. However, not many people live that long, as anyone who falls ill is killed before they can reach old age. 
100. There are also other Indians who do not kill any living beings, do not grow crops, and do not have houses. They eat grass and a naturally growing grain, similar in size to a millet seed, which they collect with its husk, boil, and eat. When one of them becomes sick, they go into the wilderness and stay there. No one pays attention to whether they are sick or if they die. 
101. The Indians I have described have intimate relationships openly, similar to animals. They all have dark skin, like the Ethiopians. Their reproductive fluid, which they release into women, is not white like that of other men, but black like their skin, and is similar to that of Ethiopians. These Indians live far to the south of the Persians and were not under the rule of King Darius. 
102. Other Indians live near the town of Caspatyrus and the Pactyic region, north of the rest of India. They live like the Bactrians and are the most warlike among all Indians. They are responsible for collecting gold, as their area is a desolate sandy desert. In this desert, there are ants that are not as big as dogs but larger than foxes. The Persian king has some of these ants that were caught there. These ants live underground and dig out the sand, similar to the ants in Greece. The sand they remove from their holes is full of gold, and this is what the Indians seek in the desert. To collect the sand, the Indians use three camels each: two male camels on either side and a female camel in the middle. The man rides on the female camel, which has been separated from her young offspring. Their camels are as fast as horses and can carry heavy loads better than horses. 
103. I won't describe the appearance of a camel to Greeks, as they are already familiar with it. However, I will share some lesser-known information about camels: their hind legs have four thigh bones and four knee joints. Additionally, their reproductive organs are located towards the tail, between their hind legs. 
104. The Indians use these teams of camels to collect gold, making sure to do so when the temperature is at its highest, as the ants stay hidden underground during that time. In this region, the sun is hottest in the morning, not at midday like in other places. From sunrise until the market closes, the heat is much more intense than in Hellas at noon, causing people to sprinkle themselves with water to stay cool. At midday, the sun's heat in India is similar to that in other places. As the afternoon progresses, the sun's intensity in India is like the morning sun in other lands. As the day goes on, the temperature gradually decreases, becoming very cold by sunset. 
105. When the Indians arrive at the location with their sacks, they quickly fill them with the sand and hurry back. The Persians claim that the ants can immediately detect the Indians and start chasing them. These ants are said to be extremely fast, so the Indians need a head start while the ants are still gathering, or else they wouldn't be able to escape. As the male camels, which are slower than the females, start to fall behind, the Indians release them one by one. The female camels, on the other hand, don't get tired because they remember their young ones they left behind. This is the story told by the Persians. According to them, most of the gold obtained by the Indians comes from this method. Although the Indians also mine gold in their country, it is less plentiful compared to the gold collected from the sand. 
106. The most remote nations in the world seem to have been blessed with the finest things, just as Greece has been blessed with the best seasons. As I mentioned earlier, India is located at the farthest eastern edge of the world. In India, all four-legged and flying creatures are much larger than those found in other lands, except for the horses, which are smaller than the Median horses known as Nesaean. Furthermore, gold is very abundant in India, whether it's mined from the earth, carried by rivers, or obtained as previously described. India also has wild trees that produce wool more beautiful and superior than sheep's wool. This wool from the trees provides clothing for the Indians. 
107. Arabia is the southernmost inhabited country in the world, and it is the only place that produces frankincense, myrrh, casia, cinnamon, and gum-mastich. All of these, except for myrrh, are difficult for the Arabians to obtain. They collect frankincense by burning storax, which is a substance that Phoenicians transport to Hellas. By burning storax, they can gather frankincense, as the trees that produce these spices are protected by small, colorful, winged snakes. Many of these snakes surround each tree, and they are the same snakes that attack Egypt. The only way to drive these snakes away from the trees is by using the smoke from burning storax. 
108. The Arabians also believe that their country would be full of these snakes if it weren't for a natural phenomenon that seems to occur among them, similar to what happens with vipers. It appears that nature, in its wisdom, has made timid and edible creatures more prolific, so they don't become extinct due to being eaten, while fewer offspring are born to strong and troublesome creatures. For example, the hare is hunted by every animal, bird, and human, so it has a high reproduction rate. It is the only creature that can conceive while already pregnant, resulting in unborn offspring at different stages of development. On the other hand, the powerful and bold lioness gives birth to only one cub in her lifetime. This is because, during childbirth, she expels her uterus along with the cub. The reason for this is that when the cub first starts to move inside its mother, its sharp claws tear the uterus, and as it grows, it continues to scratch and tear. By the time the cub is ready to be born, there is hardly any of the uterus left intact. 
109. If the vipers and winged serpents of Arabia reproduced like other snakes, it would be impossible for humans to live there. However, during mating, the female snake bites the male's neck right after he releases his seed and doesn't let go until she has bitten through. The male dies in this manner, but the female also faces consequences. To avenge their father, the unborn young snakes eat through their mother's insides, eventually making their way out. Other snakes, which are harmless to humans, lay eggs and produce a large number of offspring. The winged serpents of Arabia do appear to be numerous, but that's because they are only found in Arabia and not in any other part of the world. 
110. The Arabians collect frankincense using the previously mentioned method, and they gather casia in the following way: they cover their bodies and faces, except for their eyes, with oxhides and other skins. Casia grows in a shallow lake, which is surrounded by bat-like creatures that make loud, squeaky noises and put up a strong fight. To collect the casia, the Arabians must protect their eyes from these creatures. 
111. The process of gathering cinnamon is quite unusual. Its origin and the land where it grows are unknown, but it is believed to grow in the places where Dionysus was raised. There are large birds that carry dry sticks, known as cinnamon from the Phoenicians, to their nests on steep cliffs, which are unreachable by humans. To solve this problem, the Arabians cut dead oxen, donkeys, and other large animals into big pieces, place them near the birds' nests, and then move away. The birds reportedly fly down, pick up the animal pieces, and carry them to their nests. However, the nests cannot support the weight and end up breaking and falling down the mountainside. The Arabians then collect the fallen cinnamon sticks. This is how cinnamon is said to be gathered and brought from Arabia to other countries. 
112. Ledanon, also known as ladanon by the Arabians, has an even more peculiar origin. It is the most fragrant substance that comes from a rather unpleasant source - the beards of male goats. It forms in their beards like gum in trees. This substance is used in making various perfumes, and there is nothing the Arabians burn more frequently than incense. 
113. Arabia is a land full of wonders, and its scent is as sweet as if it were divine. The region is also home to two remarkable types of sheep that cannot be found anywhere else. One of these sheep has tails that are as long as nine feet. If they were to drag their tails on the ground, they would be damaged due to friction. To prevent this, every shepherd in Arabia has enough carpentry skills to make small carts that support the tails, attaching each tail to its own cart. The other type of sheep has a tail that is an impressive three feet wide. 
114. In the region where the south meets the west, Ethiopia extends towards the sunset. This land is rich in resources, producing an abundance of gold, enormous elephants, various wild trees, and ebony wood. The people of Ethiopia are known for their remarkable height, attractiveness, and longevity. 
115. The most remote lands in Asia and Africa have been discussed, but as for the farthest regions in Europe towards the west, certainty is lacking. There is doubt about the existence of a river called Eridanus by foreigners, which flows into the northern sea and is said to be the source of our amber. Additionally, the Tin Islands, where our tin is obtained, remain unknown. The name Eridanus itself seems more like a Greek invention by a poet rather than a foreign name. Despite thorough efforts, no one has been able to confirm the existence of a sea beyond Europe. What is known is that our tin and amber come from the most distant places. 
116. In the northern part of Europe, there is an abundance of gold. However, it is unclear how this gold is produced. It is said that one-eyed men called Arimaspians steal it from griffins, but this seems unbelievable, as it is hard to imagine one-eyed men with the same nature as other humans. Nevertheless, the most remote lands, which encompass and surround the rest of the world, are likely to possess the finest and rarest treasures we can imagine. 
117. There is a valley in Asia surrounded by mountains with five passes. This valley once belonged to the Chorasmians and was bordered by the lands of the Chorasmians, Hyrcanians, Parthians, Sarangians, and Thamanaei. However, since the Persians took control, it has been owned by the king. A large river called Aces flows from the surrounding mountains and splits into five channels, which used to provide water to the lands of the neighboring peoples through the different passes.  But since the Persians came to power, the king has blocked the mountain passes and closed each passage with a gate. With the water trapped, the valley turns into a lake as the river flows in with no way out. The people who used to rely on the water now face great difficulties, as they need it for their crops like millet and sesame. In the winter, they receive rain like everyone else, but in the summer, they desperately need the water. When they don't have access to water, they go to Persia with their families and cry and wail outside the king's palace until he orders the opening of the river gate for those in the most urgent need. Once their land has received enough water, that gate is closed, and the king opens another for the next group in need. It is said that the king makes a lot of money from this, in addition to the regular tribute, by charging for opening the gates. That is the story of this situation. 
118. One of the seven men who rebelled against the Magus, Intaphrenes, met his end due to his own aggressive actions shortly after the uprising. He wanted to enter the palace and speak with the king. According to the law, those who had rebelled against the Magus were allowed to enter the king's presence without announcement, as long as the king was not engaged in intimate relations with one of his wives. Intaphrenes, being one of the seven, insisted on his right to enter without notice. However, the gatekeeper and the messenger stopped him, saying that the king was with one of his wives. Intaphrenes believed they were lying, so he drew his sword and cut off their noses and ears. He then attached these to his horse's bridle, placed it around the men's necks, and let them go. 
119. The injured men showed themselves to the king and explained why they had been treated so badly. Worried that the other six rebels might have been involved, Darius questioned each of them to ensure they had no part in the incident. Once he was convinced, he arrested Intaphrenes, his sons, and his entire household, suspecting they were planning a rebellion. They were imprisoned and scheduled for execution. Intaphrenes' wife, in her grief, persistently wept and lamented at the palace gates. Eventually, she moved Darius to pity, and he sent a messenger to tell her that he would spare the life of one imprisoned family member, whomever she chose. After careful thought, she chose her brother. Darius was surprised by her decision and asked why she would save her brother over her husband and children. She replied that if she lost her husband and children, she could remarry and have more children, but she could never have another brother since her parents were no longer alive. Darius found her response wise and, as a result, released her brother and her eldest son. However, he executed the rest of the family. And so, one of the seven rebels met his end. 
120. While Cambyses was still unwell, the following events took place. Oroetes, a Persian, was appointed as the governor of Sardis by Cyrus. Oroetes had a wicked desire to capture and kill Polycrates of Samos, even though Polycrates had never harmed or insulted him, and they had never even met. The reason for this, according to most people, was as follows. Oroetes and another Persian named Mitrobates, who was the governor of the province at Dascyleium, were sitting at the king's doors when they began to argue and compare their accomplishments. Mitrobates taunted Oroetes, saying, "You can't be considered a real man since you haven't added the nearby island of Samos to the king's territory. It's an island so easy to conquer that a local man with just fifteen soldiers managed to revolt against its rulers and now rules it himself." Some believe that Oroetes, angered by this insult, wanted not only to punish Mitrobates but also to completely destroy Polycrates, who was the reason for the taunt. 
121. However, a few people believe that the reason for Oroetes' actions was different. They say that when Oroetes sent a messenger to Samos with a request (the details of which are unknown), the messenger found Polycrates relaxing in the men's quarters, accompanied by Anacreon of Teos. When the messenger entered and spoke to Polycrates, he didn't turn or respond, either because he wanted to show disrespect to Oroetes or simply by coincidence. 
122. There are two reasons given for Polycrates' death; you can choose which one to believe. As a result, Oroetes, who was in Magnesia near the Maeander River, sent Myrsus, a Lydian and son of Gyges, with a message to Samos after learning about Polycrates' intentions. Polycrates was the first Greek, as far as we know, to aim for control of the sea, not counting Minos of Cnossus or anyone else who may have ruled the sea before him. He had high hopes of ruling Ionia and the islands. Upon learning of Polycrates' intentions, Oroetes sent him this message: "Oroetes has a message for Polycrates: I understand that you have big ambitions, but you don't have enough money to achieve them. Follow my advice, and you will succeed while also saving me. King Cambyses wants me dead, and I have reliable information about this. If you help me and my money escape, you can take some for yourself and let me keep the rest. This way, you'll have enough wealth to rule all of Hellas. If you don't believe me about the money, send someone you trust, and I'll prove it to them." 
123. Upon hearing this, Polycrates was pleased and willing to help. Since he had a strong desire for money, he first sent one of his fellow citizens, Maeandrius, son of Maeandrius, to check the situation. Maeandrius was Polycrates' scribe and later dedicated all the luxurious furnishings from Polycrates' men's quarters to the Heraeum. When Oroetes learned that someone was coming to inspect the money, he filled eight chests with stones, leaving only a small space at the top. He then placed gold on top of the stones, locked the chests, and kept them ready. Maeandrius arrived, saw the chests, and reported back to Polycrates. 
124. Polycrates decided to visit Oroetes, despite the strong warnings from his diviners and friends, as well as a dream his daughter had. In her dream, she saw her father high in the sky, being washed by Zeus and anointed by Helios. After this vision, she tried everything to convince him not to go on the journey to meet Oroetes. Even as he was leaving for his fifty-oared ship, she predicted bad things would happen to him. Polycrates threatened her, saying that if he returned safely, she would remain unmarried for a long time. She replied with a prayer, hoping his threat would come true, as she would rather stay unmarried for a long time than lose her father. 
125. Polycrates ignored all advice and sailed to meet Oroetes with a large group of followers, including Democedes, son of Calliphon, a man from Croton who was the most skilled doctor of his time. However, as soon as Polycrates arrived in Magnesia, he was brutally murdered in a manner that was unworthy of him and his ambitions. In fact, among Greek rulers, only the kings of Syracuse could rival Polycrates in terms of splendor. After killing him in a gruesome way, Oroetes crucified Polycrates. He allowed the Samians who accompanied him to leave, telling them to be grateful for their freedom, while he enslaved the non-Samians and the servants of Polycrates' followers. Polycrates' death in the air fulfilled his daughter's dream in every aspect. He was washed by Zeus when it rained, and anointed by Helios as his body sweated under the sun. 
126. Polycrates' successful streak came to an end with his death. However, it wasn't long before Oroetes faced punishment for his actions. After Cambyses' death and the Magi's rule, Oroetes remained in Sardis, where he didn't help the Persians regain the power they had lost to the Medes. Instead, he caused more chaos by killing two important Persians: Mitrobates, the governor from Dascyleium who had mocked him about Polycrates, and Mitrobates' son, Cranaspes. In addition to many other violent acts, Oroetes also set a trap for a messenger from Darius who had brought him an unpleasant message. He killed the messenger on his way back, hiding both the man's body and his horse. 
127. When Darius became king, he wanted to punish Oroetes for all his wrongdoings, especially for killing Mitrobates and his son. However, he thought it wasn't wise to send an army openly against the satrap, since everything was still chaotic and he was new to the royal power. He also knew that Oroetes was very powerful, with a thousand Persian spearmen as guards and control over the Phrygian, Lydian, and Ionian provinces. So, Darius came up with a different plan. He gathered the most prominent Persians and spoke to them, saying, "Fellow Persians, who among you will promise to help me deal with Oroetes, not through force, but with cunning? In situations that require cleverness, force is not the answer. So, who will either bring Oroetes to me alive or kill him? He has caused us nothing but harm, killing two of our own, Mitrobates and his son, and even murdering my messengers sent to summon him. His arrogance is unbearable. We must punish him with death before he causes us even greater harm." 
128. Darius asked for help, and thirty men volunteered, each wanting to do the task themselves. Darius told them not to argue but to draw lots. The lot fell to Bagaeus, son of Artontes. Bagaeus then wrote many letters about various topics and sealed them with Darius' seal. He took the letters to Sardis and presented them to Oroetes.  As Bagaeus arrived and met with Oroetes, he handed each letter one by one to a royal scribe to read, as all the king's governors had scribes. Bagaeus gave the letters to test the loyalty of the spearmen, to see if they would turn against Oroetes. He noticed that they were greatly influenced by the letters and their content. Then, he gave another letter which said, "Persians! King Darius forbids you to be Oroetes' guard." Upon hearing this, the spearmen lowered their weapons. Encouraged by their obedience, Bagaeus gave the scribe the final letter, which read, "King Darius instructs the Persians in Sardis to kill Oroetes." Hearing this, the spearmen immediately drew their swords and killed Oroetes. In this way, justice was served for Polycrates the Samian, as Oroetes the Persian met his end. 
129. Oroetes' slaves and belongings were taken to Susa. Not long after, Darius injured his foot while dismounting from his horse during a hunt. The injury was so severe that his ankle joint was dislocated. Darius called for the best Egyptian doctors, who were always close by, to treat him. However, their rough treatment only made the injury worse, and Darius couldn't sleep for seven days and nights due to the pain. On the eighth day, when Darius was still in bad shape, someone who had heard about the skilled doctor Democedes of Croton in Sardis told Darius about him. Darius ordered them to bring Democedes to him as quickly as possible. They found Democedes among Oroetes' forgotten slaves, still in chains and wearing rags. They brought him to Darius immediately. 
130. When Darius met Democedes, he asked if he was trained in medicine. Democedes denied it, fearing that if he revealed his skills, he would never return to Hellas. However, Darius sensed that Democedes was hiding something and threatened him with whips and spikes. Democedes then admitted that he had some knowledge of medicine, having learned from a physician. Darius allowed Democedes to treat him, and using gentle Greek remedies instead of the Egyptians' harsh methods, Democedes helped Darius sleep and eventually healed him. Darius had not expected to regain the use of his foot, so he was very grateful. As a reward, Darius gave Democedes two pairs of golden shackles. Democedes jokingly asked if Darius intended to double his pain for healing him. Darius, amused by the response, sent Democedes to his wives. The eunuchs who escorted Democedes told the women that he was the man who had saved the king's life. Each wife took a bowl and scooped gold from a chest, generously rewarding Democedes. His servant, Sciton, collected a large sum of gold by picking up the coins that fell from the bowls. 
131. Democedes came to live with Polycrates in Croton due to his difficult relationship with his strict father. Unable to bear his father's harsh temperament, Democedes left Croton and moved to Aegina. Within his first year there, he became the most skilled physician, even without any equipment or medical tools. In his second year, the people of Aegina paid him a talent to be their public physician. In the third year, the Athenians hired him for a hundred minae, and in the fourth year, Polycrates offered him two talents, which led him to Samos. Democedes' presence contributed to the high reputation of Croton's physicians. At that time, the best doctors in Greece were from Croton, followed by those from Cyrene. Around the same period, the people of Argos were known to be the best musicians. 
132. After healing Darius in Susa, Democedes enjoyed a luxurious life. He lived in a grand house, dined with the king, and had everything he could want, except for the freedom to return to the Greeks. The Egyptian doctors who had previously treated the king were about to be executed for being less skilled than Democedes, but he pleaded with the king to spare their lives, and they were saved. Democedes also saved an Elean fortune-teller who had served Polycrates and was forgotten among the slaves. Democedes held significant influence with the king. 
133. Not long after, another incident took place. Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus and wife of Darius, developed a swelling on her chest. Initially, she kept it a secret out of embarrassment, but as it worsened, she called for Democedes. He promised to cure her, but in return, he asked her to swear that she would grant him any favor he requested, assuring her that it would not be anything disgraceful. 
134. After Democedes successfully treated Atossa, she followed his advice and spoke to Darius in their bedroom. She said, "My King, you have great power, but you're not doing enough to expand the Persian Empire. A young and wealthy ruler like you should be actively working to increase his power, so the Persians know they are led by a strong man. This will also keep them busy with war and prevent them from plotting against you. You should act now while you're still young, as wisdom grows with age but can also fade as the body ages." Darius replied, "Your words echo my thoughts. I plan to build a bridge connecting our continent to the other and lead an army against the Scythians. This will happen soon." Atossa suggested, "Leave the Scythians for now; you can conquer them later. Instead, focus on Hellas. I've heard of the beautiful women from Laconia, Argos, Attica, and Corinth, and I'd like to have them as servants. The physician who healed your foot, Democedes, is the perfect person to guide you in matters related to Hellas." Darius responded, "If you believe we should target Greece first, I think it's best to send Persian spies along with Democedes to gather information. Once I have a clear understanding, I'll prepare to attack them." 
135. Darius quickly put his plan into action. The next day, he called fifteen prominent Persians and instructed them to accompany Democedes on a journey along the coast of Hellas. He also told them to ensure Democedes' return and not let him escape. Then, Darius spoke to Democedes, asking him to show the Persians all of Greece and then come back. He offered to send Democedes' belongings to his family, promising to provide even more in return, along with a ship filled with valuable goods. Darius likely made this offer without any deceitful intentions, but Democedes was suspicious and thought it might be a test. So, he didn't accept everything immediately. Instead, he said he would leave his possessions behind for his return and only accept the ship to carry gifts for his family. After giving the same instructions to Democedes, Darius sent them all to the coast. 
136. The group traveled to the city of Sidon in Phoenicia, where they hired two triremes and a large ship filled with valuable goods. They then set sail for Hellas, mapping the coasts they visited. After exploring the most famous parts, they arrived in Tarentum, Italy. There, Aristophilides, the king of Tarentum, sympathized with Democedes and removed the steering gear from the Persian ships. He placed the Persians under guard, accusing them of being spies. While the Persians were detained, Democedes escaped to his hometown, Croton. Aristophilides only released the Persians and returned their ships' equipment after Democedes had safely reached his destination. 
137. The Persians left Tarentum and chased Democedes to Croton, where they found him in the marketplace and tried to capture him. Some people from Croton, fearing the Persian power, were willing to hand him over, but others resisted and attacked the Persians with sticks. The Persians warned the people of Croton, saying, "You're protecting an escaped slave of the King. How do you think King Darius will react to this defiance? What good will it do you if he escapes us? Which city will we attack first? Which will we try to enslave first?" However, the people of Croton ignored their threats. The Persians lost Democedes and the ship they had arrived on, so they returned to Asia without exploring the rest of Hellas, as they no longer had a guide. As they were leaving, Democedes sent them a message to tell Darius that he was engaged to the daughter of Milon, a famous wrestler whom Darius greatly admired. Democedes likely sought this marriage and paid a large sum for it to show Darius that he was influential in his own country as well as in Persia. 
138. The Persians left Croton, but their ships were wrecked on the coast of Iapygia. They were enslaved in the country until Gillus, an exile from Tarentum, freed them and returned them to Darius. In exchange, Darius offered Gillus anything he wanted. Gillus asked to be restored to Tarentum and shared his story of misfortune. However, he didn't want to cause trouble in Greece if a large expedition was launched against Italy on his behalf. So, he suggested that only the people of Cnidos should escort him, as they were friends of the Tarentines. Darius agreed and sent a message to the people of Cnidos, asking them to take Gillus back to Tarentum. They followed Darius' orders, but they couldn't convince the Tarentines to accept Gillus, and they didn't have the power to force them. This was the first time Persians from Asia came to Hellas, and they did so to explore the land for this reason. 
139. After this, King Darius conquered Samos, the largest of all city-states, whether Greek or barbarian. The reason for his conquest was as follows: When Cambyses, son of Cyrus, invaded Egypt, many Greeks joined the army, some for trade and others to see the country. Among them was Syloson, brother of Polycrates and an exile from Samos. Syloson experienced a fortunate event while in the market at Memphis, wearing a red cloak. Darius, who was then a member of Cambyses' guard and not yet a prominent figure, saw him and desired the cloak. He tried to buy it, but when Syloson noticed Darius' eagerness, he said, "I won't sell this for any amount of money, but I'll give it to you for free if you want it that much." Darius praised this gesture and accepted the garment. 
140. Syloson thought he had foolishly lost his cloak due to his generosity. However, after Cambyses' death and the rebellion against the Magus, Darius became the king. Syloson learned that the new king was the man he had given the cloak to in Egypt. So, he went to Susa and sat in the king's waiting room, claiming to be one of Darius' benefactors. When the doorkeeper informed the king, Darius wondered which Greek benefactor he could be indebted to. He hadn't had much interaction with Greeks since becoming king. Nevertheless, he asked for Syloson to be brought in to explain himself. The doorkeeper brought Syloson in, and the interpreters asked him who he was and what he had done to call himself the king's benefactor. Syloson then told the story of the cloak and how he had given it to Darius. Darius said, "Most generous man, you gave me a gift when I had no power. Even if it was a small one, I was grateful then, and I am grateful now. In return, I offer you gold and silver in abundance, so you never regret helping Darius, son of Hystaspes." Syloson replied, "Do not give me gold or silver, O king, but give me Samos, my homeland, which is now ruled by a slave since my brother Polycrates was killed by Oroetes. Give it to me without killing or enslaving its people." 
141. Upon hearing this, Darius sent an army led by Otanes, one of the seven, with instructions to follow Syloson's requests. Otanes then went to the coast and prepared his army for action. 
142. At that time, Samos was governed by Maeandrius, son of Maeandrius, who had been given authority by Polycrates. He wanted to be the fairest ruler, but it was not easy. When he learned about Polycrates' death, he first built an altar to Zeus the Liberator and created a sacred space around it, which can still be seen in the city's outskirts. After doing this, he gathered all the citizens and spoke to them: "As you know, I have inherited Polycrates' power and can rule over you. However, I don't want to do what I criticize in others. I never liked the idea of Polycrates or any other man dominating people like themselves. Polycrates has met his fate, and now I invite you to share his power as I declare equality. I only ask that six talents of Polycrates' wealth be reserved for me, and that I and my descendants maintain the priesthood of Zeus the Liberator, whose temple I have founded. Now, I grant you freedom." This was Maeandrius' promise to the Samians. However, one of them stood up and replied, "You are not even worthy to rule us, you low-born and insignificant person. Instead, you should explain how you managed the money you've had control over." 
143. Telesarchus, an influential citizen, made this statement. However, Maeandrius realized that if he gave up his power, someone else would seize control. So, he decided not to relinquish it. Retreating to the acropolis, he summoned the citizens one by one, pretending to discuss the money. Instead, he captured and imprisoned them. Later, Maeandrius fell ill, and his brother Lycaretus believed he was going to die. In order to easily take control of Samos, Lycaretus killed all the prisoners. It seemed that they had no desire to be free. 
144. When the Persians returned Syloson to Samos, nobody opposed them. Instead, Maeandrius and his supporters proposed to leave the island peacefully under a truce. Otanes agreed to this, and after the agreement was made, the highest-ranking Persians sat down, facing the acropolis. 
145. Maeandrius, the ruler, had a mentally unstable brother named Charilaus, who was tied up in a dungeon for some wrongdoing. Charilaus heard what was happening and saw the Persians sitting peacefully through the dungeon window. He shouted loudly, asking to speak with Maeandrius. His brother heard him and ordered Charilaus to be released and brought to him. As soon as he was brought in, Charilaus angrily urged Maeandrius to attack the Persians. "Even though I'm your brother and didn't do anything to deserve being imprisoned, you tied me up and locked me away," he said. "But when you see the Persians taking over your land, you don't have the courage to fight back, even though you could easily defeat them? If you're scared of them, give me your foreign guards, and I'll punish the Persians for coming here. As for you, I'll make sure you can safely leave the island." 
146. Charilaus made this suggestion, and Maeandrius followed it. In my opinion, he didn't do this because he was naive enough to think he could defeat the king, but because he didn't want Syloson to easily regain control of Samos without any issues. He wanted to provoke the Persians and weaken Samos as much as possible before giving it up, knowing that if the Persians were harmed, they would be extremely angry with the Samians. Moreover, he knew he could escape the island whenever he wanted, as he had built a secret passage from the acropolis to the sea. So, Maeandrius left Samos, while Charilaus armed all the guards, opened the acropolis gates, and attacked the Persians. The Persians thought they had reached a full agreement and were caught off guard. The guards attacked and killed the highest-ranking Persians, those who were carried in litters. While this was happening, the rest of the Persian forces arrived as reinforcements. Under pressure, the guards retreated back into the acropolis. 
147. The Persian leader, Otanes, saw the significant loss the Persians had experienced. He intentionally ignored the order given to him by Darius when he left, which was not to kill or enslave any Samians but to hand over the island to Syloson without any damage. Instead, he ordered his soldiers to kill everyone they captured, including men and boys. While some Persians besieged the acropolis, the others killed everyone they encountered, both inside and outside the temples. 
148. Maeandrius escaped from Samos and sailed to Lacedaemon. After arriving there with the possessions he had taken from his homeland, he often displayed silver and gold drinking cups. While his servants cleaned these cups, he would talk with the king of Sparta, Cleomenes, the son of Anaxandrides, and invite him to his house. Cleomenes was always amazed by the cups, and Maeandrius would tell him to take as many as he wanted. Maeandrius made this offer two or three times, but Cleomenes, showing his strong integrity, refused to accept. However, Cleomenes realized that there were others in Lacedaemon who might be tempted by Maeandrius' offer of the cups. So, he went to the ephors (Spartan officials) and told them it would be best for Sparta if this Samian stranger left the country, to prevent him from persuading Cleomenes or any other Spartan to do something wrong. The ephors listened to his advice and banished Maeandrius by making an official proclamation. 
149. Regarding Samos, the Persians cleared it of its inhabitants and handed it over to Syloson as an empty island. However, later on, Otanes, the Persian general, assisted in repopulating the land. This decision was influenced by a dream he had and a medical condition that affected his genitals. 
150. While the fleet was away at Samos, the Babylonians started a rebellion. They had prepared well for this during the reign of the Magus and the uprising of the seven, using the chaos to gather supplies for a siege. Somehow, this went unnoticed. Finally, they openly revolted and took the following actions: they sent away all the mothers and each person chose one woman from their household to make bread. As for the remaining women, they were gathered together and killed to prevent them from using up the bread supplies. 
151. Upon hearing about the rebellion, Darius gathered his troops and marched towards Babylon to lay siege to the city. However, the Babylonians didn't seem worried about the siege. They went up to the wall's ramparts and mocked Darius and his army with gestures and words. One of them even shouted, "Why are you waiting around, Persians? You'll only capture us when mules give birth." The Babylonian who said this didn't actually believe that a mule would ever give birth. 
152. After a year and seven months, Darius and his entire army were frustrated because they couldn't capture Babylon. Darius had tried every possible trick and strategy, including the one used by Cyrus to conquer the city, but nothing worked. The Babylonians were always on guard, making it impossible for Darius to succeed in taking the city. 
153. During the twentieth month of the siege, a remarkable event occurred involving Zopyrus, the son of Megabyzus, who was one of the seven men who overthrew the Magus. One of Zopyrus' mules, which was carrying food, unexpectedly gave birth. At first, Zopyrus didn't believe the news, but after seeing the foal himself, he instructed those who witnessed it to keep quiet. He then remembered the words of the Babylonian at the beginning of the siege, who said that the city would be captured when mules gave birth. With this statement in mind, Zopyrus believed that it was now possible to take Babylon. He thought that divine intervention was at play, both in the Babylonian's words and in the birth of the foal from his own mule. 
154. Once Zopyrus believed that it was destined for Babylon to fall, he approached Darius and asked if capturing the city was crucial to him. When Darius confirmed its importance, Zopyrus started looking for a way to ensure the city's downfall by himself, as the Persians highly valued and rewarded exceptional service. He couldn't think of any other method to achieve this goal than to severely injure himself and then defect to the Babylonians. So, without hesitation, he mutilated himself by cutting off his nose and ears, disfiguring his hair, and whipping himself before presenting himself to Darius. 
155. The king was shocked to see such a highly respected man in such a mutilated state. He jumped up from his throne, cried out, and asked Zopyrus who had done this to him and why. Zopyrus replied, "No one but myself did this, O King, because I couldn't bear the thought of Assyrians laughing at Persians." Darius responded, "You try to justify a terrible act by saying it was for the sake of those under siege. But how will the enemy surrender sooner because you mutilated yourself? You must have been out of your mind to disfigure yourself like this." Zopyrus said, "If I had told you my plan, you wouldn't have allowed me to do it. But now that I've done it, we can capture Babylon if you follow my instructions. I'll go to the city in my current state and tell them that you did this to me. I believe I can convince them and gain a position of command. On the tenth day after I enter the city, send a thousand men from the least important part of your army to the gate called the gate of Semiramis. On the seventh day after that, send two thousand more to the gate called the gate of the Ninevites. After twenty more days, send four thousand to the Chaldean gate. Allow these soldiers to carry only daggers as weapons. After the twentieth day, order the rest of your army to attack the entire wall, positioning the Persians at the gate of Belus and the Cissian gate. I believe that after I've proven myself to the Babylonians, they'll entrust me with the keys to their gates. Then it will be up to me and the Persians to do what's necessary." 
156. Following his instructions, Zopyrus went to the gates, pretending to be a deserter. The guards on the towers saw him and came down to open half of the gate slightly. They asked him who he was and why he was there. Zopyrus told them he was deserting to their side. Hearing this, the gatekeepers took him to the Babylonians' general assembly. There, Zopyrus presented a pitiful sight, claiming that Darius had inflicted these injuries on him because he had advised the king to withdraw his army, as they couldn't find a way to capture the city. He told the Babylonians, "I come as a great help to you and a great threat to Darius, his army, and the Persians. He won't get away with mutilating me like this. I know all his plans." That's what he said. 
157. When the Babylonians saw the highly respected Persian man without his nose and ears, covered in blood from the whipping, they were convinced that he was telling the truth and had come to help them. They were ready to give him everything he asked for, and he requested a command position. Once he got this, he followed the plan he had made with Darius. On the tenth day, Zopyrus led the Babylonian army to surround and kill the thousand soldiers that Darius had sent out first. Seeing his actions matched his words, the Babylonians were thrilled and eager to serve him in every way. After the agreed number of days, Zopyrus led another group of Babylonians and killed the two thousand soldiers from Darius' army. The Babylonians praised Zopyrus for this accomplishment as well. Once the agreed number of days passed again, he led his men to the designated location, where he surrounded and killed the four thousand soldiers. After this, Zopyrus became the most important person in Babylon. He was made the commander of their armies and the guardian of their walls. 
158. When Darius attacked the entire wall according to the plan, Zopyrus' betrayal became clear. While the townspeople were defending the wall against Darius' attack, Zopyrus opened the Cissian and Belian gates, allowing the Persians to enter. The Babylonians who saw what he did ran to the temple of the god they called Belus. Those who hadn't seen it stayed in their positions until they too realized they had been betrayed. 
159. Babylon was captured for the second time, and when Darius gained control over the Babylonians, he destroyed their walls and removed all their gates, which Cyrus hadn't done during the first capture of Babylon. Darius also impaled about three thousand prominent men, while the rest of the people were allowed to continue living in the city. Since the Babylonians had killed their own women out of fear for their food supply, as mentioned earlier, Darius provided them with new wives to ensure future generations. He ordered each neighboring nation to send a certain number of women to Babylon. In total, fifty thousand women were gathered, and they became the mothers of the current inhabitants of the city. 
160. Darius believed that no Persian had ever done a greater service than Zopyrus, except for Cyrus, who was incomparable. Darius often said that he would prefer Zopyrus to be without injuries rather than having twenty more Babylons in addition to the one he already had. He greatly honored Zopyrus, giving him valuable gifts every year and allowing him to govern Babylon for his entire life without paying any tribute. He also provided Zopyrus with many other benefits. Zopyrus was the father of Megabyzus, who led an army in Egypt against the Athenians and their allies. Megabyzus' son was another Zopyrus, who later defected from the Persians to join Athens.
