1. After Cyrus passed away, his son Cambyses took over his position as ruler. Cambyses was the child of Cyrus and Cassandane, who was the daughter of Pharnaspes. When Cassandane died before Cyrus, he was very sad and made all his people mourn for her too. Cambyses saw the Ionians and Aeolians as slaves that he got from his father. He planned a trip to attack Egypt and brought some of these Greek people with him, along with others he controlled. 
2. Before Psammetichus became the king of Egypt, the Egyptians thought they were the oldest people in the world. But when Psammetichus became king and wanted to find out who the oldest people really were, they started to believe that the Phrygians were older than them and everyone else. Since Psammetichus couldn't find the answer by asking around, he came up with a plan. He took two newborn babies from regular families and gave them to a shepherd to raise with his sheep. He told the shepherd not to let anyone speak to the children and to keep them alone in a quiet place. The shepherd was supposed to feed them goat milk and take care of them. Psammetichus did this because he wanted to hear what language the children would speak first, after they stopped making baby noises. His plan worked. One day, after the shepherd had been taking care of the children for two years, they both ran to him, reaching out their hands and saying "Bekos!" when he came in. The shepherd didn't say anything at first, but after hearing the word many times, he told the king. Psammetichus listened to the children himself and found out that "Bekos" was a Phrygian word for bread. Because of this, the Egyptians agreed that the Phrygians were older than them. I heard this story from the priests at the temple of Hephaestus in Memphis. The Greeks have a different version, where they say Psammetichus had the children raised by women who couldn't speak because their tongues were cut out. But that's just one of the many silly things the Greeks say. 
3. I heard more stories while talking to the priests of Hephaestus in Memphis, and I also visited Thebes and Heliopolis to see if the people there would tell me the same stories as the ones in Memphis. People say that the ones in Heliopolis are the smartest Egyptians. I won't share the stories about the gods, except for their names, because I think everyone knows about them already. I'll only mention them when it's necessary for the story I'm telling. 
4. Everyone agreed on this story about people in the past: The Egyptians were the first to count years and divide them into twelve parts based on the seasons. They figured this out by looking at the stars. Their way of counting time is more accurate than the Greeks, who add an extra month every two years to make the seasons match up. The Egyptians, on the other hand, have twelve months with thirty days each and add five extra days every year. This way, their calendar lines up with the seasons. The Egyptians also said they were the first to use the names of twelve gods, which the Greeks later borrowed. They were the first to build altars, statues, and temples for these gods and to carve images of them in stone. They showed me that most of this was true. According to them, the first human king of Egypt was named Min. During his time, all of Egypt, except for the Thebaic region, was a swamp. The land we see now was underwater, north of Lake Moeris, which is a seven-day journey up the river from the sea. 
5. I believe their story about the land is true. Even if someone hasn't heard it before, they can easily understand that the part of Egypt where the Greeks travel to is actually land given to the Egyptians by the river. This is true not only for the lower area but also for the land up to three days' journey above the lake, which is similar to the rest, even though the priests didn't mention this. Here's why the land of Egypt is like this: when you're coming to Egypt from the sea and you're still a day away from the shore, if you drop a measuring line into the water, you'll find mud at a depth of eleven fathoms. This shows that the land extends this far out into the sea. 
6. Additionally, the length of Egypt's coastline is sixty "schoeni." This measurement is for the part of Egypt that stretches from the Plinthinete Gulf to the Serbonian Marsh, which is located below the Casian Mountain. The distance between these two points is sixty schoeni. People with small amounts of land measure it in feet, while those with more land use miles. Those with a lot of land use parasangs, and those with a vast amount of land use schoeni. A parasang is equal to three and three-quarters miles, and a schoenus, which is an Egyptian measurement, is twice that. 
7. So, according to this calculation, the length of Egypt's coastline is 450 miles. The land from the sea to Heliopolis is wide, flat, and filled with marshes and water. The distance from the sea to Heliopolis is about the same as the distance from the altar of the twelve gods in Athens to the temple of Olympian Zeus in Pisa. When comparing these two distances, there's only a small difference of about two miles. The journey from Athens to Pisa is just under 200 miles, which is also the distance between the sea and Heliopolis. 
8. Past Heliopolis, Egypt becomes a narrow land. On one side, it's bordered by the mountains of Arabia, which stretch from north to south and continue towards the Red Sea. These mountains contain the quarries used to build the pyramids in Memphis. The mountains extend in the direction I mentioned, and their widest point from east to west is about a two months' journey. The easternmost part of these mountains produces frankincense. On the other side, Egypt is bordered by a range of rocky mountains in Libya, where the pyramids are located. These mountains are covered in sand and run in the same direction as the Arabian mountains, towards the south. Beyond Heliopolis, the narrow part of Egypt is only a fourteen-day journey along the river. Between the mentioned mountain ranges, the land is flat, and at its narrowest point, there seemed to be only about thirty miles between the Arabian and Libyan mountains. Beyond this area, Egypt becomes a wide land again. That's what this country is like. 
9. It takes nine days to travel by river from Heliopolis to Thebes, covering a distance of 608 miles, or 81 schoeni. So, here's a summary of the distances in Egypt: the coastline is 450 miles long, and the distance from the sea to Thebes is 765 miles. The distance between Thebes and the city known as Elephantine is 225 miles. 
10. Most of the land I've mentioned, as the priests told me and I also observed, was formed by deposits for the Egyptians. The area between the mountain ranges above Memphis seemed to have once been a sea gulf, similar to the regions around Ilion, Teuthrania, Ephesus, and the Maeander plain, although on a larger scale. The rivers that contributed to the formation of these lands are not as significant as any of the Nile's five mouths. There are other rivers, not as large as the Nile, that have had significant effects on the landscape. I could list their names, but one of the main ones is the Achelous, which flows through Acarnania and into the sea, turning half of the Echinades Islands into mainland. 
11. In Arabia, not far from Egypt, there is a gulf stretching inland from the Red Sea. Its length and width are as follows: from its inner end to the open sea, it takes a ship with oars forty days to travel, and at its widest point, it takes half a day to cross. The tides in this gulf rise and fall daily. I believe that where Egypt is now, there was once a similar gulf, extending from the northern sea towards Ethiopia, while the Arabian gulf I mentioned stretched from the south towards Syria. The ends of these gulfs were close to each other, with only a small piece of land separating them. If the Nile were to flow into this Arabian gulf, wouldn't it fill up with silt within twenty thousand years? In fact, I think it would fill up within ten thousand years. So, isn't it reasonable to assume that a much larger gulf existed in the past and was filled up by such a large and active river? 
12. As for Egypt, I agree with those who say, and I strongly believe, that it was formed in a unique way. I've seen how Egypt extends into the sea beyond the surrounding land, and there are shells on the mountains and salt covering various surfaces, even on the pyramids. The only sandy mountain in Egypt is the one above Memphis. Furthermore, Egypt's landscape is different from its neighbors, such as Arabia, Libya, and Syria (which is inhabited by people along the Arabian coast). Egypt has black, crumbling soil, which seems like it was carried down the river from Ethiopia. In contrast, Libya has redder, sandy soil, while Arabia and Syria have clay and stones. 
13. The priests told me something about Egypt that serves as strong evidence: when King Moeris ruled, a rise of thirteen feet in the river would water all of Egypt below Memphis. Moeris had been dead for less than nine hundred years when I heard this from the priests. But now, if the river doesn't rise at least twenty-six or twenty-five feet, the land won't be flooded. In my opinion, the Egyptians living in the lower parts of the river, especially near Lake Moeris and the Delta, will face difficulties if their land continues to rise and expand, and the Nile no longer floods it. The Egyptians once said that the Greeks would face a similar problem. They knew that the Greek land is watered by rain, not by river water like theirs. They predicted that if the heavens didn't send rain to the Greeks, they would suffer from drought and famine, as they have no other source of water besides Zeus. 
14. The Egyptians' prediction about the Greeks was accurate. Now, let's consider the situation for the Egyptians themselves: if the land below Memphis continues to rise, as I mentioned earlier, won't the Egyptians living there face hunger since their country doesn't receive rain and the river won't be able to flood their fields? Currently, the people in Egypt, and perhaps the entire world, rely on the land with minimal effort. They don't need to plow, hoe, or do any other work that most people do to grow crops. The river naturally rises, waters the fields, and then recedes. Each person simply sows their field, sends pigs to tread down the seeds, waits for the harvest, and then uses the pigs to thresh the grain before storing it. 
15. If we agree with the Ionians' belief that only the Delta region is considered Egypt, with its coastline stretching from the Watchtower of Perseus to the Salters' at Pelusium, and inland as far as the city of Cercasorus where the Nile splits towards Pelusium and Canobus, then the rest of Egypt would be part of Libya and Arabia. Following this idea, we can conclude that there was once no land for the Egyptians. As the Egyptians themselves say, and as I also believe, the Delta is made of alluvial land and has only recently formed. If there was no land for them in the past, it's incorrect to think that they were the oldest nation on earth, and their experiment to determine the first language spoken by children would be pointless. I argue that the Egyptians didn't come into existence along with the Delta, but have been around since the beginning of the human race. As the land grew, many Egyptians stayed behind, while others spread across the expanding area. Regardless of this, the Theban district, which covers an area of seven hundred and sixty-five miles, was once known as Egypt. 
16. If our understanding is correct, then the Ionians are mistaken about Egypt. However, if their opinion is right, it's clear that they, along with other Greeks, cannot accurately divide the entire earth into three parts: Europe, Asia, and Libya. They would need to add a fourth part, the Delta of Egypt, if it doesn't belong to either Asia or Libya. According to their view, the Nile isn't the river that separates Asia and Libya; instead, the Nile splits at the top of the Delta, placing this land between Asia and Libya. 
17. We won't focus on the Ionians' opinion, and instead, we'll share our own understanding of the matter: Egypt is the entire country inhabited by Egyptians, just as Cilicia and Assyria are the countries inhabited by Cilicians and Assyrians. We don't know of any clear boundary between Asia and Libya, except for the borders of Egypt. However, if we follow the Greeks' belief, we would consider all of Egypt, starting from the Cataracts and the city of Elephantine, to be divided into two parts, belonging to both Libya and Asia. The Nile, beginning from the Cataracts, splits Egypt into two parts as it flows towards the sea. Up to the city of Cercasorus, the Nile flows in one channel, but then it divides into three. One of these, called the Pelusian mouth, flows east; the second, called the Canobic mouth, flows west. The main channel of the Nile, after reaching the top of the Delta, flows straight through the middle of the Delta into the sea. This part has the largest and most famous waters and is called the Sebennytic mouth. There are also two channels that separate from the Sebennytic and flow into the sea: the Saïtic and the Mendesian. The Bolbitine and Bucolic mouths are not natural but man-made channels. 
18. In fact, the oracle of Ammon supports my view that Egypt is as extensive as I have described. I learned this after I had already formed my opinion about Egypt. The people of Marea and Apis, located in the part of Egypt bordering Libya, thought they were Libyans and not Egyptians. They didn't like the religious law that forbade them from eating cow meat, so they sent a message to Ammon. They claimed they had no connection to Egypt because they lived outside the Delta and didn't follow its customs. They wanted permission to eat all foods. However, the god denied their request, saying that all the land watered by the Nile was Egypt, and everyone who lived downstream from the city of Elephantine and drank the river's water were Egyptians. That was the oracle's response to them. 
19. When the Nile floods, it overflows not only the Delta but also the areas known as Libyan and Arabian, sometimes reaching as far as two days' journey from either bank, although this distance can vary. I couldn't learn anything about its nature from the priests or anyone else. I was eager to find out why the Nile floods for a hundred days starting from the summer solstice, and then, after this period, its water level decreases, leaving the river low throughout the winter until the next summer solstice. I couldn't get any information from the Egyptians about why the Nile behaves differently from all other rivers. I wanted to know this and also asked why there were no breezes coming from the Nile like there are from other rivers. 
20. However, some Greeks, wanting to be known for their cleverness, have proposed three theories about this river. I will mention two of them just to show what they are. One theory suggests that the Etesian winds cause the river to flood by preventing the Nile from emptying into the sea. But there are times when the Etesian winds don't blow, and the Nile still behaves the same way. Moreover, if the Etesian winds were the cause, other rivers flowing against these winds should be affected like the Nile, and even more so, since they are smaller and have weaker currents. Yet there are many rivers in Syria and Libya, and they don't act like the Nile at all. 
21. The second theory is less based on knowledge than the first one and sounds more extraordinary: it suggests that the river behaves the way it does because it flows from the Ocean, which surrounds the entire world. 
22. The third theory is the most believable, but it is also the most incorrect of all. It has no more truth than the others. This theory suggests that the Nile flows from melting snow, but the river actually flows from Libya through the heart of Ethiopia and enters Egypt. So, how can it come from snow when it originates from the hottest places and flows into mostly cooler lands? For someone who can think logically about this, the main and strongest evidence against the river flowing from snow is that the winds from Libya and Ethiopia are hot.  Secondly, the region doesn't experience rain or frost. After snowfall, it must rain within five days, so if it snowed, there would be rain in these lands. Thirdly, the people living there have dark skin due to the heat. Additionally, kites and swallows live there all year round, and cranes migrate to these places every year to escape the cold weather of Scythia. If there were even a small amount of snow in the region where the Nile flows and originates, none of these things would happen, as logic dictates. 
23. The theory about the Ocean is vague and doesn't require disproving, as I am not aware of any Ocean river. I believe that Homer or some earlier poet created this name and incorporated it into their poetry. 
24. If I must share my own thoughts on these unclear matters after rejecting the proposed theories, I'll explain why I believe the Nile floods in the summer. During winter, storms push the sun away from its usual path, causing it to pass over the inland regions of Libya. To put it simply, whichever area the sun is closest to or directly above, it is likely that the land becomes very dry and the rivers in that region dry up. 
25. A more detailed explanation is as follows. When the sun passes over the inland parts of Libya, it affects the region in this way: since the air is always clear, the land warm, and the winds cool, the sun acts as it does in the summer when it passes through the middle of the sky. It attracts water towards itself and then pushes it away to the inland areas. The winds catch this water and spread it, causing it to evaporate. As expected, the winds coming from that region, the south and southwest, bring the most rain. However, I believe that the sun doesn't release all the water it takes from the Nile each year, but instead holds some close to itself. As winter becomes milder, the sun returns to the middle of the sky and draws water from all rivers equally. During this time, other rivers experience high floods due to the amount of water from rainfall, as the land is exposed to rain and erosion. In the summer, these rivers have lower water levels because of the lack of rain and the sun's evaporation effect. The Nile, on the other hand, doesn't receive rainwater and is the only river affected by the sun's evaporation in winter. As a result, its water level decreases significantly compared to its summer levels. This is natural since, in summer, the sun attracts water from all rivers, not just the Nile, while in winter, only the Nile is affected. 
26. I am convinced that the sun is the cause of this phenomenon. In my opinion, the sun also causes the dryness of the air in these areas because it heats the air as it passes through, making it always feel like summer in the inland parts of Libya. However, if the positions of the seasons were to change, with the south wind and summer taking the place of the north wind and winter, and the north wind replacing the south wind, the sun would then pass over the inland parts of Europe during winter, just as it currently does over Libya. I believe that if this were to happen, the sun would have the same effect on the Ister River in Europe as it does on the Nile. 
27. Regarding why no breeze comes from the river, I believe it's because breezes don't naturally come from very hot places; they always originate from areas that are very cold. 
28. Let's accept the current situation as it is and has always been. Regarding the sources of the Nile, no one I spoke to, whether Egyptian, Libyan, or Greek, claimed to know them, except for the keeper of sacred treasures of Athena in the Egyptian city of Saïs. I thought he was joking when he said he had precise knowledge, but this was his story. Between the city of Syene in Thebaid and Elephantine, there are two hills with sharp peaks, one named Crophi and the other Mophi. The bottomless springs of the Nile rise between these hills, with half the water flowing north towards Egypt and the other half flowing south towards Ethiopia. He mentioned that Psammetichus, the king of Egypt, tested whether the springs were bottomless by lowering a rope of many thousand fathoms' length into the spring, but he couldn't reach the bottom. If this keeper was telling the truth, I think he demonstrated that there are strong currents and an upward flow of water, causing the rope to not reach the bottom when it's lowered due to the water rushing against the hills. 
29. I couldn't learn anything more from anyone else, but I did my best to gather information by traveling as far as the city of Elephantine and asking people along the way. Beyond Elephantine, the land starts to rise. In this area, boats must be pulled by ropes on both sides, similar to how an ox is harnessed. If the rope breaks, the strong current will carry the boat away. This part of the river takes four days to travel by boat and has many twists, similar to the Maeander River. After passing through this section, you reach a flat plain with an island called Takhompso in the Nile. From Elephantine onwards, the land is inhabited by Ethiopians. The island's population is half Ethiopian and half Egyptian. Near the island, there's a large lake with nomadic Ethiopians living along its shores. After crossing the lake, you reach the Nile again, which flows into the lake. You then have to walk along the riverbank for forty days because the Nile has sharp rocks and reefs that make it impossible for boats to pass. After completing this forty-day journey, you can travel by boat again for twelve days until you reach a large city called Meroe, considered the capital of Ethiopia. The people of Meroe worship only Zeus and Dionysus, whom they greatly honor. They have a sacred place for divination dedicated to Zeus and send out armies whenever and wherever the god commands them through his oracle. 
30. From the city of Meroe, you travel by water for the same distance as you did from Elephantine to the Ethiopian capital, and you arrive in the land of the Deserters. These Deserters are called Asmakh, which means "those who stand on the left hand of the king" in Greek. They were once 240,000 Egyptian soldiers who rebelled and joined the Ethiopians. This happened during the reign of Psammetichus. At that time, there were watchposts at Elephantine facing Ethiopia, at Daphnae of Pelusium facing Arabia and Assyria, and at Marea facing Libya. Even in my time, the Persians still maintain these posts, with guards stationed at Elephantine and Daphnae. The Egyptian soldiers had been on guard for three years without being relieved, so they decided to join forces and rebel against Psammetichus, heading to Ethiopia. When Psammetichus heard about this, he pursued them. When he caught up with them, he gave a long speech asking them not to abandon their families and the gods of their ancestors. In response, one of the soldiers pointed to his genitals and said that they would have wives and children wherever they went. So, they arrived in Ethiopia and offered their services to the king. In return, the king asked them to drive out certain Ethiopians he was feuding with and take over their land. As a result, these Ethiopians adopted Egyptian customs and became more civilized through their interactions with the Egyptians. 
31. People have knowledge of the Nile up to a distance of four months' travel by land and water, in addition to the part that is in Egypt. Based on calculations, it takes that long to travel from Elephantine to the land of the Deserters. The river flows from the west, where the sun sets. Beyond this point, no one has clear information to share, as the entire region is uninhabited due to the extreme heat. 
32. I heard a story from some men of Cyrene who said they had visited the oracle of Ammon and spoke with Etearchus, the king of the Ammonians. Their conversation eventually turned to the Nile and how no one knows its source. Etearchus told them about a visit he once had from some Nasamonians, a Libyan people living near the Syrtis and slightly east of it. When they arrived, they shared news about the Libyan desert. They told Etearchus that some young men from their leading families, who were proud and reckless, decided to explore the deserts of Libya to see if they could go farther than anyone else. They chose five of their group by drawing lots and set off with plenty of water and provisions. They first traveled through inhabited lands, then through the region of wild beasts, and finally into the desert, heading west. After crossing a wide sandy area for many days, they found trees growing in a plain. As they picked fruit from the trees, they encountered small men who were shorter than average. These men took the young explorers to their city, where all the people were of similar stature and had dark skin. The Nasamonians couldn't understand the language of these people, and the people couldn't understand the Nasamonians. The men led the young explorers across large marshes until they reached a city by a great river that flowed from the west towards the east. Crocodiles could be seen in the river. The people in this city were also short and had dark skin. 
33. Etearchus the Ammonian shared enough of the story, as told to me by the men of Cyrene. He mentioned that the Nasamonians returned and that the people they encountered were all wizards. Etearchus believed that the river flowing past the city was the Nile, and there is good reason to think so. The Nile flows through the middle of Libya, and based on educated guesses from visible signs, it likely originates from a similar distance as the Ister River. The Ister River flows from the land of the Celts and the city of Pyrene, right through the center of Europe. The Celts live beyond the Pillars of Heracles, next to the Cynesii, who are the westernmost people in Europe. The Ister River crosses Europe entirely and ends in the Euxine Sea, at Istria, which is home to Milesian colonists. 
34. The Ister River is well-known since it flows through inhabited areas, but no one can speak of the Nile's source, as it runs through the uninhabited and deserted parts of Libya. I have shared everything I could learn about its course, which eventually leads to Egypt. Egypt is located across from the mountainous region of Cilicia. From there, it takes a person without any burden five straight days to reach Sinope on the Euxine Sea. Sinope is situated across from where the Ister River meets the sea. Based on this, I believe the Nile's path through Libya is similar to the course of the Ister River. 
35. The Nile is a fascinating topic, but I will focus on discussing Egypt, as it is full of wonders and has countless remarkable features. Egypt has a unique climate and a river unlike any other, and its customs and laws are mostly different from those of other people. In Egypt, women handle buying and selling, while men stay at home and weave. Unlike other cultures where the weaving technique involves pushing the woof upwards, Egyptians push it downwards. Men carry loads on their heads, while women carry them on their shoulders. Women urinate standing up, and men do so sitting down. Egyptians use the bathroom indoors and eat outdoors in the streets, explaining that private matters should be done alone, while non-private activities can be done openly. No Egyptian woman is dedicated to serving any god or goddess, but men can serve all deities, male or female. Sons are not forced to support their parents if they don't want to, but daughters must do so even if they are unwilling. 
36. In most places, priests of the gods have long hair, but in Egypt, they are bald. When mourning the dead, people in other cultures shave their heads, while Egyptians shave at other times and let their hair and beard grow after a death. Egyptians are unique in keeping their animals inside their homes. While others rely on wheat and barley for food, Egyptians consider it disgraceful to do so. Instead, they use a coarse grain called spelt. They mix dough with their feet and collect mud and dung with their hands. Only Egyptians and those who learn from them practice circumcision. Men in Egypt have two garments, while women have only one. When it comes to boats, Egyptians fasten rings and sail sheets inside, while others do it outside. Egyptians write and calculate in the opposite direction of the Greeks, who go from left to right. Egyptians claim their way of writing is towards the right, while the Greek way is towards the left. They use two types of writing: one is called sacred, and the other is known as demotic. 
37. The Egyptians are extremely religious, more than any other people, and have many customs. They drink from bronze cups, which they clean daily, a practice followed by everyone. They always wear freshly washed linen and practice circumcision for cleanliness, as they value cleanliness over appearance. Priests shave their entire body every other day to prevent lice or any other impurities while serving the gods. They wear a single linen garment and papyrus sandals, with no other clothing or footwear allowed. They wash in cold water twice a day and twice every night. Their religious practices are countless. Priests also receive many benefits. They don't have to spend their own resources, as sacred food is prepared for them. Each priest receives plenty of beef, goose, and grape wine daily. However, they are not allowed to eat fish. Egyptians don't grow beans in their country, and if any are found, they won't eat them, either raw or cooked. Priests consider beans unclean and can't even stand to see them. Each god has multiple dedicated priests, with one being the high priest. When a high priest dies, his son takes over his position. 
38. The Egyptians believe that bulls are sacred to Epaphus, so they carefully examine them before considering them pure. If they find even a single black hair, the bull is deemed impure. A designated priest checks the animal by making it stand and lie down, and examining its tongue to ensure it meets specific purity criteria. The priest also checks the hairs on the tail to see if they grow naturally. If the bull passes all these tests, the priest marks it by wrapping papyrus around its horns, then applies sealing-earth and stamps it with his ring. After this, the bull is led away. Sacrificing a bull without the priest's mark is punishable by death. This is how they approve the animal for sacrifice, and I will now describe the actual process of the sacrifice. 
39. After bringing the marked animal to the altar for sacrifice, they start a fire and pour wine over the victim while calling upon the god. They then cut its throat and separate the head from the body. They remove the skin from the carcass and place many curses on the head, which is then taken away. If there is a market with Greek traders, the head is sold there; if not, it is thrown into the river. The curses they place on the head wish that any harm threatening those who sacrifice or all of Egypt falls upon that head. In all sacrifices, the Egyptians follow the same practice regarding the heads of the sacrificed animals and the pouring of wine. No Egyptian will eat the head of any creature that was once alive, as it is against their customs. 
40. The process of removing the insides and burning the sacrificed animals varies for each ritual. However, I will now describe the procedure for the goddess they consider the greatest and for whom they celebrate the most important festival. After praying as previously mentioned, they remove the entire stomach from the skinned bull, leaving the internal organs and fat inside the body. They then cut off the legs, the end of the loin, the shoulders, and the neck. Next, they fill the remaining carcass with pure bread, honey, raisins, figs, frankincense, myrrh, and other types of incense. They then burn the carcass, pouring a large amount of oil on it. The people fast before the sacrifice and mourn while the carcass is burning. Once the mourning is over, they share a meal made from the remaining parts of the sacrificed animal. 
41. All Egyptians sacrifice unblemished bulls and bull-calves, but they do not sacrifice cows, as they are sacred to Isis. The images of Isis have a woman's form with cow-like horns, similar to how the Greeks depict Io. Cows are considered the most sacred animals by all Egyptians. Therefore, no Egyptian man or woman will kiss a Greek man, or use a knife, spit, or cauldron belonging to a Greek, or taste the flesh of an unblemished bull cut with a Greek knife. When cattle die, they are dealt with in the following manner: cows are thrown into the river, while bulls are buried in the suburbs of each city, with one or both horns left uncovered as a sign. When the carcass decomposes and the appointed time arrives, a boat comes to each city from the island called Prosopitis, a large island in the Delta region. Many towns are located on Prosopitis, and the one from which the boats come to collect the bulls' bones is called Atarbekhis, which has a highly sacred temple of Aphrodite. People from this town go to different cities to dig up the bones, which are then taken and buried together in one place. This burial practice is followed for all other animals as well, as they are not allowed to be killed either. 
42. All those who have a temple of Zeus of Thebes or belong to the Theban district sacrifice goats but avoid touching sheep. The only gods worshipped by all Egyptians are Isis and Osiris, who they believe is Dionysus. Those who have a temple of Mendes or belong to the Mendesian district sacrifice sheep but avoid touching goats. The Thebans, and others who follow their example by not touching sheep, provide the following reason for their practice: They say that Heracles desperately wanted to see Zeus, but Zeus did not want to be seen by him. Eventually, after Heracles prayed, Zeus found a way to show himself by displaying the head and wearing the fleece of a ram that he had skinned and beheaded. This is why the Egyptian images of Zeus have a ram's head, and the Ammonians, who are colonists from Egypt and Ethiopia and speak a mixed language of both countries, imitate this practice. The Ammonians likely got their name from the Egyptian word for Zeus, "Amon." For this reason, the Thebans consider rams sacred and do not sacrifice them. However, once a year during the festival of Zeus, they cut and skin a single ram and place its fleece on the image of Zeus, as in the story. They then bring an image of Heracles near it. After doing this, everyone at the temple mourns for the ram and then buries it in a sacred coffin. 
43. Regarding Heracles, I heard that he was one of the twelve gods in Egypt. However, I couldn't find any information about the other Heracles known to the Greeks. I have plenty of evidence suggesting that the name Heracles originated in Egypt and then traveled to Greece, where the Greeks named the son of Amphitryon as Heracles. Additionally, both Amphitryon and Alcmene, the parents of this Heracles, were of Egyptian descent. The Egyptians claim not to know the names Poseidon and the Dioscuri, and these gods are not considered part of the Egyptian pantheon. If the Egyptians had adopted the name of any deity from the Greeks, they would likely remember these gods, especially if they were already traveling by sea and some Greeks were also seafarers. In that case, the names of these gods would be even more familiar to the Egyptians than the name of Heracles. However, Heracles has been a very ancient god in Egypt. According to the Egyptians, the transition from the eight gods to the twelve, which includes Heracles, occurred seventeen thousand years before the reign of Amasis. 
44. Wanting to learn more about this topic, I traveled to Tyre in Phoenicia, where I had heard there was a sacred temple of Heracles. There, I saw the temple filled with many offerings, including two pillars – one made of pure gold and the other of emerald, which shone brightly at night. I spoke with the priests and asked how old their temple was. Their answer did not match the beliefs of the Greeks, as they said the temple was built when Tyre was first founded, around 2,300 years ago. In Tyre, I also saw another temple dedicated to the so-called Thasian Heracles. I then visited Thasos, where I found a temple of Heracles built by the Phoenicians who settled there while searching for Europe. This happened about five generations before the birth of Heracles, the son of Amphitryon, in Greece. My research clearly shows that Heracles is an ancient god. Furthermore, I believe that those Greeks who have established and practice two forms of worship for Heracles are most accurate. They offer sacrifices to one Heracles as an immortal, calling him the Olympian, while they bring offerings to the other as a deceased hero. 
45. The Greeks also tell many other thoughtless stories, including a ridiculous one about Heracles. They say that when he arrived in Egypt, the Egyptians put a crown on him and led him in a procession to be sacrificed to Zeus. At first, Heracles followed quietly, but when they tried to sacrifice him at the altar, he fought back and killed them all. This story shows that the Greeks don't really understand the nature and customs of the Egyptians. How could the Egyptians sacrifice humans when they are not even allowed to sacrifice animals, except for pigs, bulls, unblemished bull-calves, and geese? Moreover, since Heracles was just one man, as they claim, how could he possibly kill so many people? While discussing this, I hope to maintain the goodwill of gods and heroes! 
46. The Egyptians I mentioned earlier do not sacrifice any goats, male or female, because the Mendesians consider Pan to be one of the eight gods who existed before the twelve gods. In their paintings and sculptures, Pan is depicted with the head and legs of a goat, just like in Greek art. This doesn't mean they believe he actually looks like that or is different from other gods, but I don't want to discuss why they represent him this way. The Mendesians regard all goats as sacred, with male goats being even more sacred than females, and goatherds are highly respected. One particular male goat is considered the most sacred, and when it dies, there is a great mourning throughout the Mendesian region. In the Egyptian language, the word "Mendes" refers to both the male goat and Pan. During my lifetime, a strange event happened in this region: a male goat openly mated with a woman, and this became public knowledge. 
47. Egyptians consider pigs to be unclean animals. Firstly, if an Egyptian accidentally touches a pig, they immediately go to the river and immerse themselves in it, fully clothed. Secondly, swineherds, even though they are native Egyptians, are the only people not allowed to enter any Egyptian temple. They cannot marry outside their profession, nor can anyone marry into their community. Swineherds only marry among themselves. Egyptians do not believe in sacrificing pigs to any god except the Moon and Dionysus. They sacrifice pigs to these gods during the full moon and then eat the meat. The Egyptians have a reason for sacrificing pigs at this festival while avoiding them at others, but it is not appropriate for me to share it. When they sacrifice pigs to the Moon, they place the end of the tail, the spleen, and the caul together, covering them with all the fat found around the belly, and then burn it all. They eat the rest of the meat during the full moon when the sacrifice takes place, but they won't eat it on any other day. Poor people with limited resources make pigs out of dough and then sacrifice them. 
48. During the festival of Dionysus, on the evening of the celebration, everyone offers a piglet. They kill it in front of their door and then give it to the swineherd who sold it, for him to take away. The rest of the Dionysus festival is celebrated by the Egyptians in a similar way to the Greeks, except for the dances. Instead of using a phallus, they have created two-foot-tall puppets, controlled by strings, with a large male member that moves and is almost as big as the rest of the body. Women carry these puppets around the villages, with a flute-player leading the way and the women following, singing songs about Dionysus. There is a sacred legend that explains why the male member is so large and the only part of the body that moves, but it is not mentioned here. 
49. I believe that Melampus, the son of Amytheon, was not only aware of this sacrifice but also quite familiar with it. Melampus was the one who introduced the Greeks to the name of Dionysus, the way to sacrifice to him, and the phallic procession. He didn't reveal every detail about the subject, as later teachers provided more information, but it was from him that the Greeks learned to carry the phallus in honor of Dionysus and adopted their current practices. I think that Melampus, being a perceptive man, acquired the prophetic art and taught the Greeks many things about Dionysus that he learned from Egypt, making only a few changes. I won't say that the rituals performed in Egypt and those performed by the Greeks were developed independently, as they would then have a Greek origin and not be recent additions. I also won't say that the Egyptians adopted this or any other custom from the Greeks. Instead, I believe that Melampus primarily learned the worship of Dionysus from Cadmus of Tyre and the people who accompanied Cadmus from Phoenicia to the land now known as Boeotia. 
50. In fact, the names of almost all the gods came to Greece from Egypt. Through my inquiries, I am convinced that these names came from foreign lands, and I believe that they mainly came from Egypt. Apart from the names of Poseidon, the Dioscuri, Hera, Hestia, Themis, the Graces, and the Nereids, which I have already mentioned, the names of all the other gods have always existed in Egypt. I am only repeating what the Egyptians themselves say. The gods whose names the Egyptians claim not to know, I think, were named by the Pelasgians, except for Poseidon, whose knowledge they learned from the Libyans. The Libyans are the only nation that has had the name of Poseidon among them from the beginning, and they have always honored this god. However, the Egyptians do not usually pay tribute to heroes. 
51. So, the Greeks adopted these customs and others from the Egyptians, which I will mention later. However, the ithyphallic images of Hermes did not come from the Egyptians; they were introduced by the Pelasgians. The Athenians were the first Greeks to adopt this practice from the Pelasgians and then passed it on to others. At that time, the Athenians were already considered Greeks when the Pelasgians came to live with them and started to be seen as Greeks as well. Anyone who has participated in the rites of the Cabeiri, which the Samothracians learned from the Pelasgians and now practice, will understand what I mean. Samothrace was once inhabited by the Pelasgians who later lived among the Athenians, and it is from them that the Samothracians received their rites. So, the Athenians were the first Greeks to create ithyphallic images of Hermes, following the teachings of the Pelasgians. The Pelasgians shared a sacred story about this, which is revealed in the Samothracian mysteries. 
52. In the past, during their sacrifices, the Pelasgians used to call upon gods without using any specific names or titles (I know this because I was told at Dodona). This was because they hadn't heard of any names yet. They called them gods because they believed these beings set everything in order and maintained all arrangements. After a long time, they first learned the names of the other gods from Egypt, and much later, the name of Dionysus. Eventually, they asked the oracle at Dodona about these names, as this oracle was considered the oldest in Greece and was the only one at that time. When the Pelasgians asked Dodona if they should use the names that came from foreign lands, the oracle told them to do so. From that moment on, they used the names of the gods in their sacrifices, and later, the Greeks adopted these names from the Pelasgians. 
53. The origins of each god, whether they had always existed, and their appearances were unknown to people until relatively recently. I believe that Hesiod and Homer lived around four hundred years before my time, and they were the ones who taught the Greeks about the gods' lineage, gave them their names, defined their roles and powers, and described their appearances. However, the poets who are said to have lived before Hesiod and Homer, in my opinion, actually came later. The earlier information about the gods comes from the priestesses of Dodona, while the later details related to Hesiod and Homer are my own observations. 
54. The Egyptians have a story about the origin of the oracles in Greece and the one in Libya. The priests of Zeus in Thebes told me that two priestesses were kidnapped from Thebes by Phoenicians. They said that one was taken and sold in Libya, while the other was sold in Greece. According to them, these women were the first to establish places for divination in those countries. When I asked how they could be so sure about this, they replied that their people had searched extensively for these women but were never able to find them. However, they eventually learned the story they shared with me. 
55. I heard the following story from the Theban priests, and the prophetesses of Dodona added more details: Two black doves flew from Thebes in Egypt, one to Libya and the other to Dodona. The dove that arrived in Dodona landed on an oak tree and began to speak like a human, saying that a place for divination from Zeus should be established there. The people of Dodona believed this message was divine, so they set up the oracle shrine. The dove that went to Libya, according to the Libyans, told them to create an oracle for Ammon, which is also dedicated to Zeus. This story was confirmed by the Dodonaean priestesses, the oldest being Promeneia, followed by Timarete and the youngest, Nicandra. The other temple servants at Dodona also believed this to be true. 
56. Here's what I believe about this story. If the Phoenicians really did kidnap the sacred women and sold one in Libya and the other in Greece (which was formerly called Pelasgia), then I think the woman sold in Greece ended up in Thesprotia. As a slave there, she set up a shrine for Zeus under a growing oak tree. It makes sense that she would remember the temple of Zeus in Thebes, where she had served before. Once she learned the Greek language, she began teaching divination and mentioned that her sister had been sold in Libya by the same Phoenicians who sold her. 
57. I think the people of Dodona called these women "doves" because they spoke a foreign language that sounded like bird noises to them. When the woman started speaking in a way they could understand, they said the dove spoke human language. As long as she spoke in a foreign language, they thought her voice sounded like a bird. It's impossible for a dove to actually speak like a human. The fact that the dove was black suggests that the woman was Egyptian. The methods of divination at Thebes in Egypt and Dodona are very similar, and the practice of interpreting messages from sacrificed animals also came from Egypt. 
58. It appears that the Egyptians were the first to create formal gatherings, processions, and religious services. The Greeks learned these practices from them. I believe this is true because the Egyptian ceremonies are clearly very old, while the Greek ones are more recent. 
59. The Egyptians hold grand gatherings not just once a year, but frequently. The most important and enthusiastically celebrated festival is in honor of Artemis in the town of Bubastis. The next major festival is in honor of Isis at Busiris, a town located in the middle of the Egyptian Delta, which has a large temple dedicated to Isis (known as Demeter in Greek). The third biggest celebration is at Saïs, in honor of Athena. The fourth is the festival of the sun at Heliopolis, the fifth is for Leto at Buto, and the sixth is for Ares at Papremis. 
60. When the people travel to Bubastis, they go by river, with many men and women in each boat. Some women shake rattles, others play flutes, while the rest of the women and men sing and clap their hands. As they pass by other towns along the river, they bring their boat close to the shore. Some women continue making noise, while others shout playful insults at the local women; some dance, and others stand up and lift their skirts. They do this whenever they pass by a riverside town. Upon arriving at Bubastis, they celebrate with a big festival, offering many sacrifices. More wine is consumed at this feast than during the entire year. It is customary for a large number of men and women, around seven hundred thousand according to the locals, to gather there, but children do not attend. 
61. This is what happens at the festival in Bubastis. I have already mentioned how they celebrate the feast of Isis at Busiris. There, after the sacrifice, a huge number of men and women mourn together. However, it wouldn't be respectful for me to reveal who they are mourning for. The Carians, who live in Egypt, go even further by cutting their foreheads with knives. This act demonstrates that they are foreigners and not Egyptians. 
62. When people gather at Saïs on the night of the sacrifice, they keep lamps burning outside their houses. These lamps are saucers filled with salt and oil, with a floating wick, and they burn all night. This event is called the Feast of Lamps. Egyptians who don't attend this festival still make sure to keep their own lamps burning on the night of the sacrifice, so the lights can be seen not only at Saïs but all over Egypt. There is a sacred story that explains why this night is so brightly lit and honored. 
63. When people visit Heliopolis and Buto, they only offer sacrifices. At Papremis, sacrifices are offered and rituals are performed just like in other places. However, when the sun sets, a few priests stay near the statue of the god, while most of them stand at the entrance of the temple holding wooden clubs. Over a thousand men, who have made vows and also carry wooden clubs, gather in front of the temple. The day before, the priests move the god's statue, which is inside a small gilded wooden shrine, to another sacred building. A few priests who remain with the statue pull a four-wheeled wagon carrying the shrine and the statue inside it. The other priests stand in front of the temple doors, not allowing them to enter, while the men who made vows support the god and fight against the defending priests. A fierce battle with clubs takes place, resulting in many head injuries and possibly even deaths, although the Egyptians claim that nobody dies. The locals say that this custom started because of a story involving Ares, the god of war. Ares' mother lived in this temple, and he was raised separately from her. When he grew up, Ares wanted to visit his mother, but her attendants didn't recognize him and refused to let him pass. So, Ares brought men from another town to overpower the attendants and see his mother. They believe that this story is the reason why the fighting with clubs became a tradition during the festival. 
64. Moreover, the Egyptians were the first to consider it a religious rule not to engage in sexual activities with women inside temples or to enter a temple after such activities without washing themselves. Almost all other cultures are less cautious about this than the Egyptians and Greeks, and they believe that a man is just like any other animal. They argue that animals and birds can be seen mating in temples and sacred areas, and if this was offensive to the gods, the animals wouldn't do it. This is the explanation given by others for practices that I personally don't approve of. 
65. The Egyptians are very strict about preventing any disrespect towards their temples. Even though Egypt is close to Libya, it doesn't have many animals. All animals are considered sacred; some live with humans, while others don't. If I were to explain why they are considered sacred, I would have to discuss divine matters, which I prefer to avoid. I only mention such topics when it's absolutely necessary. However, I will describe how people usually take care of these animals. Men and women are assigned as caretakers to provide food for each type of animal, and this responsibility is passed down from father to son. People in each town, when fulfilling their vows, pray to the god associated with the animal. They shave either all, half, or a third of their children's heads and weigh the hair against a certain amount of silver. The caretaker of the animals receives the silver, which is equal to the weight of the hair, and uses it to buy fish to feed the animals. This way, the animals are provided with food. Anyone who intentionally kills one of these creatures is punished with death. If the killing is accidental, the person must pay a penalty determined by the priests. Killing an ibis or a hawk, whether intentional or not, results in the death penalty. 
66. There are many domestic animals, and there would be even more if it weren't for the behavior of cats. When female cats have kittens, they no longer want to mate with male cats. The males, unable to mate with them, resort to stealing, killing, and carrying off the kittens, although they don't eat them. The mother cats, now without their young and wanting more, become willing to mate with the males again, as they love having offspring. When a fire breaks out, something unusual happens with the cats. The Egyptians form a loose circle around the fire, focusing more on the cats than putting out the flames. However, the cats manage to slip through or jump over the people and jump into the fire. When this occurs, there is a great mourning in Egypt. When a cat dies of natural causes in a household, the residents shave their eyebrows as a sign of mourning. If a dog dies, they shave their heads and entire bodies. 
67. When cats die, they are taken to sacred buildings in the town of Bubastis, where they are preserved and buried. Female dogs are buried by the people in their own towns in sacred coffins, and the same is done with mongooses. Shrewmice and hawks are taken to Buto, while ibises are taken to the city of Hermes for burial. There aren't many bears, and the wolves are only slightly larger than foxes. Both bears and wolves are buried wherever they are found. 
68. Crocodiles have the following characteristics: They don't eat anything during the four winter months. They have four legs and can live both on land and in water. They lay eggs and hatch them on land, spending most of the day on dry ground and the night in the river, as the water is warmer than the air and dew. Crocodiles grow from a very small size to an impressive length of twenty-eight feet or more. Their eggs are only slightly larger than goose eggs, and the baby crocodiles are proportionally small. Crocodiles have eyes similar to pigs' eyes and long, protruding teeth. They are the only animals without a tongue. They don't move their lower jaw but instead bring their upper jaw down onto the lower one, which is unique among animals. They also have strong claws and a tough, impenetrable scaly hide on their backs. They are blind in water but have excellent vision in the air. Since crocodiles live in water, their mouths are full of leeches. All birds and animals avoid them, except for the sandpiper, which has a peaceful relationship with the crocodile because it provides a helpful service. When the crocodile comes ashore and opens its mouth, usually to catch the west wind, the sandpiper enters its mouth and eats the leeches. The crocodile appreciates this service and doesn't harm the sandpiper. 
69. Some Egyptians believe crocodiles are sacred, while others see them as enemies. People living near Thebes and Lake Moeris consider them very sacred. Each household raises a crocodile, training it to be tame. They decorate the crocodile with glass and gold ornaments on its ears and bracelets on its front legs. They provide special food and offerings for the crocodile and take good care of it while it's alive. After the crocodile dies, it is preserved and buried in a sacred coffin. However, in the Elephantine region, crocodiles are not considered sacred and are even eaten. Egyptians don't call these animals crocodiles, but "khampsae." The Ionians named them crocodiles because they resemble the lizards found in their walls. 
70. There are many methods of hunting crocodiles, but I'll describe the one I find most interesting. The hunter puts a piece of hog's back on a hook and lets it float into the river. He then stays on the bank with a young, live pig and hits it. As the pig squeals, the crocodile is attracted to the sound and encounters the bait, which it swallows. The hunters then pull the line, bringing the crocodile to the shore. The first thing the hunter does is cover the crocodile's eyes with mud. Once this is done, it becomes much easier to handle the crocodile, which would otherwise be quite difficult. 
71. In the region of Papremis, hippopotamuses are considered sacred, but not in other parts of Egypt. They have the following features: four legs with split hooves like cattle, a blunt nose, a horse-like mane, visible tusks, a horse's tail and voice, and they are as large as the biggest bull. Their skin is so thick that when it's dried, it can be used to make spear shafts. 
72. Otters can also be found in the river, and Egyptians consider them sacred. They also believe that certain fish, such as the scale-fish and the eel, are sacred. Among birds, the fox-goose is said to be sacred to the god of the Nile. 
73. There is another sacred bird called the phoenix. I have never seen it myself, only pictures of it, because it rarely comes to Egypt - only once every 500 years, according to the people of Heliopolis. They say the phoenix appears when its parent dies. If the pictures are accurate, the bird has golden and red feathers and looks like an eagle in size and shape. The story of what this bird does is quite incredible. It is said that the phoenix flies from Arabia to the temple of the Sun, carrying its deceased parent encased in myrrh. To do this, the bird first creates a myrrh egg that is as heavy as it can carry. It then tests its ability to lift the egg. Once it can lift the egg, the phoenix hollows it out, places its parent inside, and seals the opening with more myrrh. The egg, now containing the parent, weighs the same as before. The phoenix then carries the encased parent to the temple of the Sun in Egypt. This is the story of what the phoenix is believed to do. 
74. Near Thebes, there are harmless sacred snakes that are small and have two horns on top of their heads. When these snakes die, they are buried in the temple of Zeus, as they are believed to be sacred to him. 
75. There is a location in Arabia, not far from the town of Buto, where I went to learn about winged serpents. When I got there, I saw countless bones and backbones of serpents in various sizes, piled up. This spot, filled with scattered bones, is near a narrow mountain pass that leads to a large plain, which is next to the Egyptian plain. It is said that winged serpents fly from Arabia to Egypt at the beginning of spring. However, ibis birds confront and kill these invaders in the mountain pass. The Arabians mention that the Egyptians highly respect the ibis for this reason, and the Egyptians confirm this as the reason for honoring these birds. 
76. The ibis has a distinct appearance. It is entirely black, has long legs like a crane, and a sharply hooked beak. It is about the size of a landrail. This is what the ibis that fights the serpents looks like. There are two types of ibis, and the ones that interact more with humans have a featherless head and neck. Their feathers are white, except for the head, neck, wingtips, and tail, which are completely black. The legs and beak of this bird are similar to the other ibis. The serpents resemble water-snakes, and their wings are not feathered but rather similar to bat wings. This is enough information about these sacred creatures. 
77. The Egyptians living in the cultivated areas are very dedicated to preserving the memory of the past and are more knowledgeable about history than anyone else I've met. They follow a specific lifestyle to maintain their health. For three days every month, they cleanse their bodies using emetics and drenches, believing that all illnesses come from the food they eat. Even without this practice, Egyptians are among the healthiest people, second only to the Libyans. I think this is because their climate remains the same throughout the year, as changes in climate, especially seasonal changes, can cause illnesses. Egyptians eat bread made from coarse grain, which they call "cyllestis." Instead of wine, they drink a barley-based beverage since they don't have grapevines in their country. They consume fish either raw and sun-dried or preserved in brine. They also eat salted and raw quails, ducks, and small birds. All other types of birds and fish, except for the ones considered sacred by Egyptians, are eaten roasted or boiled. 
78. During the feasts of wealthy people, a man carries around a small coffin containing a lifelike image of a dead body, measuring two to four feet long. He shows it to each guest, saying, "As you drink and enjoy yourselves, look at this; for this is what you will become when you die." This is a common practice at their gatherings. 
79. The Egyptians follow the traditions of their ancestors without adding anything new. One of their remarkable customs is singing a song called the Linus-song, which is also sung in Phoenicia, Cyprus, and other places. Each nation has its own name for the song, but it's the same one that the Greeks sing and call Linus. One thing that amazes me about Egypt is where they got Linus from. It's clear that they have always sung this song, but in Egyptian, Linus is called Maneros. The Egyptians told me that Maneros was the only son of their first king, who died young. They sing this song as a tribute to him, and they said it was their earliest and only chant. 
80. There is also a custom that only the Egyptians and the Lacedaemonians, among the Greeks, share: younger men show respect to their elders by giving way to them, stepping aside, and standing up when they approach. However, there is one thing that sets the Egyptians apart from the Greeks: instead of greeting each other with words, they simply lower their hand to their knee as a form of salute. 
81. They wear linen tunics with fringes around the legs, called "calasiris," and loose white woolen cloaks over them. However, they don't bring anything made of wool into their temples or use it for burial, as it's considered disrespectful. This belief is similar to the practices known as Orphic and Bacchic, but it's actually rooted in Egyptian and Pythagorean traditions. It's also considered disrespectful for someone participating in these rituals to be buried in woolen wraps. There's a sacred story behind this belief. 
82. The Egyptians have also come up with the following ideas. Each month and day are associated with a specific god, and based on the day a person is born, it is believed that their fate, the way their life will end, and their personality are determined. Greek poets often use this concept in their work. The Egyptians have discovered more omens than any other civilization. When an omen occurs, they observe the outcome and record it. If a similar event happens again, they believe it will have the same result. 
83. In Egypt, the art of divination is not practiced by ordinary people, but rather by some of the gods. There are oracles for various gods, including Heracles, Apollo, Athena, Artemis, Ares, and Zeus, with the most revered oracle being that of Leto in the town of Buto. The Egyptians use several different methods for divination, not just one. 
84. In Egypt, the field of medicine is highly specialized, with each doctor focusing on treating only one specific illness. The country is filled with various medical professionals, including those who specialize in eye care, dental care, stomach-related issues, and internal diseases. 
85. When a respected person dies, the Egyptians follow a specific mourning and burial process. The women in the family cover their faces or heads with mud and leave the deceased's body in the house. They then walk around the city, grieving and wearing their clothes in a way that exposes their breasts, joined by the women from their extended family. Meanwhile, the men also mourn, wearing their garments in a similar manner. After the mourning period, the dead body is taken to be preserved through the process of embalming. 
86. There are professionals in Egypt who specialize in the process of embalming dead bodies. When a body is brought to them, they show the family wooden models of embalmed corpses, each representing a different level of preservation quality and cost. After the family chooses the method they want and agrees on a price, the embalmers get to work. In the most elaborate method, they remove part of the brain through the nostrils using an iron hook and treat the remaining brain with special drugs. They then make an incision near the side of the body with a sharp stone knife and remove all the internal organs. The inside of the body is cleaned by rinsing it with palm wine and crushed spices. Afterward, the cavity is filled with a mixture of ground myrrh, casia, and other spices, except for frankincense. The body is then sewn back up. The embalmers preserve the body in saltpeter for seventy days, which is the maximum time allowed for this process. Once the seventy days have passed, they wash the body and wrap it in fine linen bandages coated with a gum-like substance that Egyptians commonly use as glue. The embalmed body is then returned to the family. The family places the body inside a hollow wooden figure shaped like a person, seals it, and stores it in a special room, where the figure is positioned upright against a wall. 
87. For those who prefer a less expensive embalming method, the process is different. The embalmers use a syringe to inject cedar oil into the body through the anus, without making any incisions or removing the internal organs. They then seal the opening to prevent the oil from leaking out. The body is preserved for the designated number of days. On the final day, the cedar oil is drained from the body. The oil has a powerful effect, causing the internal organs and intestines to dissolve and be removed along with it. The saltpeter used in the preservation process causes the flesh to disintegrate, leaving only the skin and bones behind. The embalmers then return the body to the family without any further treatment. 
88. The third and most affordable method of embalming, typically used for those with less money, involves cleaning the body's insides with a purging substance. The body is then preserved for seventy days before being returned to the family. 
89. The bodies of wives of important men or women known for their beauty and reputation are not immediately handed over to the embalmers. Instead, they wait for three or four days after death. This delay is meant to prevent the embalmers from engaging in inappropriate acts with the deceased women. There was an incident where an embalmer was caught having relations with a recently deceased woman, and he was reported by his coworker. 
90. If someone, whether Egyptian or foreigner, is killed by a crocodile or drowns in the river, they must be properly embalmed and placed in a beautiful, sacred coffin. The person's body will be found ashore, and no family members or friends are allowed to touch it. Instead, the body is treated with great respect, as if it is more than human. The Nile priests themselves take care of handling and burying the body. 
91. The Egyptians generally avoid adopting Greek customs or those of other cultures. However, there is a notable exception in a large city called Khemmis, located in the Theban region near the New City. In this city, there is a square temple dedicated to Perseus, the son of Danae, surrounded by a grove of palm trees. Tall stone columns and statues stand in front of the temple, and an outer court houses a shrine with an image of Perseus. The people of Khemmis believe that Perseus often appears in their land and temple, and when his four-foot-long sandal is found, it is said to bring prosperity to all of Egypt. They honor Perseus with Greek-style celebrations, including various contests and games, with prizes such as animals, cloaks, and skins. When asked why Perseus appears only to them and why they celebrate games unlike other Egyptians, they explained that Perseus is connected to their city through his lineage. Danaus and Lynceus, who traveled to Greece, were from Khemmis, and the people trace their ancestry back to them and Perseus. They also shared a story of Perseus visiting Khemmis after obtaining the Gorgon's head from Libya, recognizing his relatives, and learning about the city's name from his mother. According to them, it was Perseus who instructed them to celebrate the games. 
92. The customs of Egyptians living in the marshlands are similar to those of other Egyptians, including the practice of having one wife, like the Greeks. They have also found ways to make their food more affordable. When the river floods the plains, many lilies called lotus grow in the water. The Egyptians gather these lilies, dry them in the sun, and then crush the poppy-like center to make loaves of bread. The root of the lotus is also edible, with a sweet taste, and is round and apple-sized. Other lilies resembling roses grow in the river as well. Their fruit is found in a separate calyx attached to the root by a stalk and looks like a wasp's comb. This fruit contains many edible seeds, similar in size to olive pits, which can be eaten fresh or dried. The Egyptians also use a plant called byblus that grows annually in the marshes. They cut off the top part for other uses and eat or sell the lower part, which is about twenty inches long. For the best taste, some people roast the byblus in a hot oven before eating it. Some Egyptians rely solely on fish for their diet. They catch the fish, remove the intestines, dry them in the sun, and then eat them dried. 
93. Fish that swim in groups are rarely born in rivers; instead, they grow in lakes. When it's time for them to reproduce, they swim out to sea in groups, with the males leading and releasing their sperm. The females follow, swallowing the sperm and becoming pregnant. Once the females become heavy with eggs, all the fish swim back to their original homes. This time, the females lead, occasionally releasing some of their eggs, which look like millet seeds. The males follow and eat these eggs. The surviving eggs eventually become new fish. Fish caught while swimming towards the sea have bruises on the left side of their heads, while those caught returning have bruises on the right side. This happens because they stay close to the left bank while swimming out to sea and return along the same bank, touching it as much as possible. They do this to avoid being carried away by the current. When the Nile River starts to rise, low and marshy areas near the river are the first to fill with water, which seeps in from the river. As soon as these areas are flooded, they become full of small fish. I believe I can guess where these fish come from. When the Nile's water level drops, the fish lay their eggs in the mud before leaving with the last of the water. When the flood returns the following year, these eggs immediately hatch into fish. 
94. Now, let's talk about the fish. Egyptians living near the marshes use an oil made from castor berries, which they call kiki. This plant, which grows wild in Greece, is planted along the banks of rivers and lakes in Egypt. It produces a lot of fruit, although it has an unpleasant smell. When they harvest the fruit, some people crush and press it, while others roast and boil it to extract the liquid. This thick liquid is useful as lamp oil and has a strong odor. 
95. To deal with the numerous mosquitoes, the Egyptians have come up with different solutions. Those who live in areas higher than the marshlands benefit from sleeping in towers, as the winds prevent mosquitoes from flying up high. However, those living near the marshes have a different approach. Each person has a fishing net, which they use to catch fish during the day. At night, they set up the net around their bed, crawl under it, and sleep. If they were to sleep wrapped in a garment or cloth, mosquitoes could still bite through it. But with the net, mosquitoes don't even dare to try. 
96. The cargo boats they use are made from acacia wood, which is similar in shape to the lotus of Cyrene, and its sap is like gum. They cut four-foot-long logs from this tree and lay them like bricks, attaching them to long stakes placed closely together to build the boat. Then, they add crossbeams on top of the logs. These boats don't have ribs, and the gaps between the logs are sealed with byblus plants. There is one rudder that goes through a hole in the boat's bottom. The mast is made of acacia wood, and the sails are made of byblus. These boats can't move upstream unless there's a strong wind, so they are usually pulled from the riverbank. To move downstream, they use a raft made of tamarisk wood, tied together with reed mats, and a heavy stone with a hole in it. The raft is connected to the front of the boat with a rope, and the stone is tied to the back. The raft floats quickly downstream, pulling the boat (called "baris") along, while the stone drags along the river bottom, keeping the boat moving straight. There are many of these boats, some able to carry several thousand talents' worth of cargo. 
97. When the Nile floods the land, only the towns remain visible above the water, looking like islands in the Aegean Sea. During this time, the rest of Egypt appears to be a large body of water. So, instead of traveling along the usual river course, people are ferried directly across the plain. In fact, when traveling by boat from Naucratis to Memphis, you pass close to the pyramids, even though the usual route goes through the Delta's point and the town of Cercasorus. Similarly, when sailing from the sea and Canobus to Naucratis, you'll travel across the plain near the towns of Anthylla and Arkhandrus. 
98. Anthylla is a well-known town, and it has a special role in providing shoes for the wife of the current king of Egypt. This tradition has been in place since Egypt came under Persian rule. The other town is likely named after Arkhandrus, the son of Phthius the Achaean and son-in-law of Danaus, as it is called Arkhandrus' town. It's possible that there was another Arkhandrus, but the name itself is not of Egyptian origin. 
99. So far, I've shared my own observations, judgments, and research. From now on, I'll share the stories I've heard from Egyptian history, along with some of my own experiences. The priests told me that Min was the first king of Egypt, and he was the one who separated Memphis from the Nile by building a dam. Before that, the river flowed close to the sandy mountains on the Libyan side. Min created a new path for the river, about twelve and a half miles above Memphis, by blocking the old path and directing the water between the hills. To this day, the Persians maintain this part of the river, reinforcing the dam every year to keep the water flowing properly. If the Nile were to break through the dam, Memphis would be at risk of flooding. After creating dry land by redirecting the river, King Min founded the city now known as Memphis, which is located in the narrowest part of Egypt. He also dug a lake to the north and west of the city, with the Nile forming its eastern boundary. Additionally, he built the great and famous temple of Hephaestus in the city. 
100. After Min, three hundred and thirty kings ruled Egypt, as the priests told me from a papyrus scroll. Among these rulers, there were eighteen Ethiopian kings and one queen from Egypt itself. The rest were all Egyptian men. The queen's name was Nitocris, the same as the Babylonian princess. Nitocris sought revenge for her brother, who was the king of Egypt before being killed by his subjects. They then made Nitocris their queen. To avenge her brother, Nitocris built a large underground chamber and invited the Egyptians who were most responsible for her brother's murder to a grand feast, pretending to celebrate the chamber's completion. While they were enjoying the feast, she secretly flooded the chamber with water from the river, killing them all. The priests told me that after doing this, Nitocris threw herself into a room filled with hot ashes to avoid facing the consequences of her actions. 
101. The priests didn't share any significant achievements or actions of the other kings, except for Moeris, the last of them. They remembered Moeris for building the northern entrance of the temple of Hephaestus, digging a large lake, and constructing pyramids near the lake. I will provide more details about the size of the lake and pyramids later. According to the priests, Moeris was responsible for all these accomplishments, while they had nothing notable to mention about the rest of the kings. 
102. I'll now talk about the king who came after the ones I mentioned earlier, named Sesostris. The priests told me that he set out with a fleet of long ships from the Arabian Gulf and conquered all the people living near the Red Sea. He continued until he reached a sea that was too shallow for his ships. After returning to Egypt, he gathered a large army and traveled across the land, conquering every nation he encountered. When he faced brave people who fought hard for their freedom, Sesostris set up pillars in their land. These pillars had inscriptions showing his name, his country, and how he had defeated them with his own power. However, when he easily captured cities that didn't resist, he put similar inscriptions on the pillars but also added drawings of female private parts. This was his way of showing that the people were cowardly. 
103. Sesostris continued his conquests, traveling through Asia and into Europe, where he defeated the Scythians and Thracians. I believe the Egyptian army didn't go any further, as the pillars can only be seen in those countries and not beyond. After that, Sesostris turned around and headed back home. When he reached the Phasis river, it's possible that he left a part of his army there to live in the country, but I can't say for sure. Alternatively, some of his soldiers might have grown tired of the long journey and decided to stay by the Phasis river. 
104. It's clear that the Colchians are of Egyptian origin, which I noticed before hearing it from others. When I asked both groups, the Colchians remembered the Egyptians better than the Egyptians remembered the Colchians. The Egyptians believed that the Colchians were part of Sesostris' army. I made this connection partly because both groups have dark skin and woolly hair, but that's not the only reason. The stronger evidence is that the Colchians, Egyptians, and Ethiopians are the only nations that have practiced circumcision from the beginning. The Phoenicians and the Syrians of Palestine admit they learned this custom from the Egyptians. The Syrians living near the Thermodon and Parthenius rivers, as well as their neighbors the Macrones, say they learned it recently from the Colchians. These are the only nations that practice circumcision, and they do it just like the Egyptians. However, I can't say whether the Egyptians or Ethiopians learned it from each other, as it's clearly an ancient custom. The fact that other nations learned circumcision through contact with Egypt is evident in this example: Phoenicians who trade with Greece stop imitating the Egyptians in this practice and don't circumcise their children. 
105. Here's another similarity between the Colchians and Egyptians: they are the only ones who make linen, and they have their own unique method of doing so. Their lifestyles and languages are also very similar. Linen has two different names: the Colchian type is called "Sardonian" by the Greeks, while the Egyptian variety is simply called "Egyptian." 
106. The pillars that Sesostris, the Egyptian king, placed in various countries are mostly gone now. However, I saw some of them in the Palestine region of Syria, with the inscriptions and drawings of women's private parts on them. In Ionia, there are also two large statues of this man carved into rock. One is on the road from Ephesus to Phocaea, and the other is on the road from Sardis to Smyrna. Both statues are over twenty feet tall, holding a spear in the right hand and a bow in the left, with the rest of the attire being a mix of Egyptian and Ethiopian styles. Across the chest, there's an inscription in Egyptian sacred characters that says, "I myself won this land with the strength of my shoulders." The statues don't reveal who the man is or where he's from, but this information can be found elsewhere. Some people who have seen these statues think they represent Memnon, but they are far from the truth. 
107. According to the priests, when the Egyptian Sesostris returned to Daphnae of Pelusium, he brought many captives from the lands he had conquered. His brother, whom he had left in charge of Egypt, invited Sesostris and his sons to a banquet. Then, he surrounded the house with wood and set it on fire. Realizing the danger, Sesostris quickly asked his wife, who was with him, for advice. She suggested that he should sacrifice two of their six sons by laying them on the fire, creating a bridge for the rest of the family to walk over and escape. Sesostris followed her advice, and as a result, two of his sons were burned, but he and the remaining sons managed to escape alive. 
108. After returning to Egypt and taking revenge on his brother, Sesostris found tasks for the large number of people he had brought with him from the conquered countries. These people were responsible for dragging the huge and long blocks of stone that were used during his reign to build the temple of Hephaestus. They were also forced to dig all the canals that exist in Egypt today, which unintentionally made the land unsuitable for horses and carts. From that time on, Egypt, despite being a flat land, could no longer use horses or carts due to the numerous canals crisscrossing the country. The king created this network of canals because Egyptians living in towns away from the Nile River faced water shortages when the floodwaters receded, leaving them with only brackish water from wells to drink. 
109. Egypt was divided by canals for this reason. The king, according to the story, also distributed the land equally among all Egyptians and used this as a source of income by collecting an annual tax. If someone lost part of their land due to the river, they could report it to Sesostris. The king would then send people to investigate and measure the reduced land area, adjusting the tax payment accordingly. I believe the Greeks learned the skill of land measurement from this practice. However, the sunclock, sundial, and the twelve divisions of the day were introduced to Greece from Babylonia, not Egypt. 
110. Sesostris was the only Egyptian king who also ruled over Ethiopia. To honor his name, he placed two fifty-foot tall stone statues of himself and his wife in front of the temple of Hephaestus, along with thirty-three-foot tall statues of his four sons. Much later, Darius the Persian wanted to place his statue alongside these, but the priest of Hephaestus stopped him. The priest argued that Darius hadn't accomplished anything as great as Sesostris, who had not only conquered the Scythians but also as many nations as Darius. Since Darius hadn't defeated the Scythians, it wouldn't be fair for him to place his statue next to Sesostris', whose achievements he hadn't matched. It is said that Darius accepted the priest's decision. 
111. When Sesostris passed away, his son Pheros became the king, according to the priests. Pheros didn't engage in any wars and eventually became blind due to an incident. One day, the Nile River flooded to a record height of thirty feet, with strong winds causing rough waters. Pheros, in a bold move, threw a spear into the swirling river. Soon after, he developed an eye disease and lost his sight.  After being blind for ten years, an oracle from the city of Buto told him that his punishment would soon end, and he could regain his sight by washing his eyes with the urine of a woman who had only been with her husband. Pheros first tried his own wife, but when that didn't work, he tested other women one by one. When he finally regained his sight, he gathered all the women he had tried, except for the one who helped him see again, into a town now called "Red Clay." He then burned the town and the women, while marrying the woman who had cured his blindness. To show gratitude for regaining his sight, Pheros dedicated many offerings in various significant temples. The most notable of these were two incredible stone obelisks placed in the temple of the Sun. Each obelisk was made from a single block, standing over 166 feet tall and 13 feet thick. 
112. The priests said that Pheros was succeeded by a man from Memphis, known as Proteus in Greek. Proteus had a beautiful and well-maintained temple complex in Memphis, located south of the temple of Hephaestus. Phoenicians from Tyre lived around this complex, and the entire area was called the Camp of the Tyrians. Within Proteus' temple complex, there was a temple called the Temple of the Stranger Aphrodite. I believe this temple is dedicated to Helen, daughter of Tyndarus, for two reasons. First, I've heard stories about Helen staying with Proteus. Second, the temple is named after the Foreign Aphrodite, which is unique among Aphrodite's temples. 
113. When I asked the priests, they shared the following story about Helen. After kidnapping Helen from Sparta, Alexandrus set sail for his homeland. However, strong winds in the Aegean Sea pushed him into the Egyptian sea, and eventually, he arrived in Egypt at the Canopic mouth of the Nile, near the Salters' region. On the coast, there was (and still is) a temple dedicated to Heracles. If a servant seeks refuge in this temple and receives sacred markings, they are protected by the god and cannot be harmed. This law has remained unchanged since its inception. Learning about this temple law, some of Alexandrus' servants escaped and sought the god's protection. They accused Alexandrus of wrongdoing, revealing the entire story of Helen and the injustice done to Menelaus. They presented their accusations to the priests and the guardian of the Nile mouth, a man named Thonis. 
114. Upon hearing the accusations, Thonis quickly sent a message to Proteus in Memphis: "A Trojan stranger has arrived, having committed a terrible act in Greece. He deceived his host, brought the man's wife, and a large amount of wealth to our land, driven here by the wind. Should we let him leave without consequences, or should we confiscate what he has brought?" Proteus replied: "Capture the man who has committed such a terrible act against his host and bring him to me, so I can hear what he has to say." 
115. Upon hearing Proteus' message, Thonis captured Alexandrus and held his ships, then brought him, Helen, all the wealth, and the temple refugees to Memphis. Once they arrived, Proteus asked Alexandrus about his identity and his journey. Alexandrus shared his background and the purpose of his voyage, but when asked about Helen, he was evasive and dishonest. The temple refugees exposed his lies and revealed the entire story of the wrongdoing. In response, Proteus made the following judgment: "If it weren't for my policy of not harming strangers who are brought to my shores by the wind, I would have punished you on behalf of the Greek, you despicable man. You committed a terrible act after enjoying your host's hospitality: you took his wife. As if that wasn't enough, you convinced her to flee with you and stole your host's wealth as well. However, since I don't harm strangers, I won't let you take this woman and the wealth. Instead, I'll keep them safe for the Greek until he comes to retrieve them. As for you and your sailors, I order you to leave my country within three days, or I will declare war on you." 
116. The priests said that this was how Helen ended up with Proteus. In my opinion, Homer also knew this story, but he chose not to use it in his epic poetry because it wasn't as fitting as the tale he eventually used. However, it's clear that he was aware of the story, as he briefly mentions the wanderings of Alexander and Helen in the Iliad, where they were carried off course and ended up in places like Sidon in Phoenicia. This can be found in the story of Diomedes' Prowess, where the verses describe the embroidered robes made by the women of Sidon, brought by Alexandrus from Sidon along with Helen. Homer also mentions it in the Odyssey, where he talks about the clever drugs that Zeus' daughter had, which she got from Thon's wife, Polydamna, an Egyptian. Egypt is known for its fertile plains that produce many drugs, some good and some harmful. Additionally, Menelaus tells Telemachus that he was eager to return home, but the gods kept him in Egypt because he hadn't offered enough sacrifices to them. These verses show that Homer knew about Alexander's journey to Egypt, as Syria is next to Egypt, and the Phoenicians, who belong to Sidon, live in Syria. 
117. These verses and passage strongly show that the Cyprian poems were not written by Homer, but by someone else. The Cyprian poems tell the story of Alexandrus arriving in Ilion with Helen in just three days from Sparta, thanks to good winds and calm seas. However, in the Iliad, it is mentioned that Alexandrus went off course while bringing her. 
118. So, that's enough about Homer and the Cyprian poems. When I asked the priests if the Greek story of what happened at Troy was true or not, they told me this, saying they had learned it from Menelaus himself. After Helen was taken, a large Greek army went to the land of Troy to help Menelaus. Once they arrived and prepared their forces, they sent messengers to Ilion, including Menelaus. When they were allowed inside the city, they demanded the return of Helen and the property Alexandrus had stolen from Menelaus, as well as compensation for the wrongs done. However, the Trojans insisted, both then and later, with or without oaths, that they didn't have Helen or the property. They said everything was in Egypt, and they couldn't fairly pay for what Proteus the Egyptian had. The Greeks thought the Trojans were making fun of them, so they besieged the city until they captured it. But when they broke through the walls, Helen wasn't there. They heard the same story as before, so they finally believed it and sent Menelaus to Proteus in Egypt. 
119. Menelaus then traveled to Egypt and up the river to Memphis. There, he told the truth about the situation and was treated with great hospitality. He got Helen back, unharmed, along with all his wealth. However, Menelaus acted unjustly towards the Egyptians. When bad weather stopped him from sailing away, and it continued for a while, he did something terrible by taking two local children and sacrificing them.  When people found out what he had done, Menelaus had to flee with his ships to Libya, where he was hated and pursued. The Egyptians didn't know where he went after that. The priests told me that they had learned some of this information by asking around, but they were certain about the events that took place in their own country. 
120. The Egyptian priests told me this story, and I believe their version about Helen. I think that if Helen had been in Ilion, she would have been returned to the Greeks, whether Alexandrus wanted it or not. It's hard to imagine that Priam or his closest advisors would risk their lives, their children's lives, and their city just so Alexandrus could be with Helen. Even if they were willing to do so at first, as the war continued and many Trojans died, including several of Priam's sons in each battle (according to the poets), I believe that Priam would have given Helen back to the Greeks to avoid further suffering, even if she had been his own wife. Alexandrus wasn't even next in line for the throne. Priam was old, but his older and more capable son, Hector, was set to become king after him. Hector shouldn't have supported his brother's actions, especially since they caused so much trouble for him and the rest of the Trojans. But since they didn't have Helen to return and the Greeks didn't believe their truthful words, I think the gods made sure the Trojans faced complete destruction to show everyone that severe punishment comes from the gods for terrible wrongdoings. That's my opinion, and I'm sharing it with you. 
121. The priests told me that after Proteus, the next king was Rhampsinitus. He built the western courtyard of the temple of Hephaestus and placed two huge statues there. The Egyptians called the northern statue Summer and the southern one Winter. They worshiped the Summer statue and treated it well, but did the opposite for the Winter statue. Rhampsinitus had a lot of silver, more than any other king after him. To keep his treasure safe, he built a stone chamber with one wall connected to his palace. The builder, however, cleverly made one stone easy to remove. When he was about to die, he told his two sons about the secret stone and how they could access the king's treasure. After their father's death, the sons stole some of the treasure. The king was puzzled when he found the treasure missing, but the chamber was still sealed. The thefts continued, so the king set traps around the treasure containers. One of the thief brothers got caught in a trap, and to avoid being recognized, he asked his brother to cut off his head. The brother did so and left with the head. The king found the headless body and hung it on the wall, ordering guards to watch it and arrest anyone who mourned for the thief. The mother of the thieves demanded her surviving son to retrieve his brother's body, or else she would reveal his crime. The son came up with a plan, using wine-filled skins on donkeys to get the guards drunk. Once they were asleep, he took his brother's body and shaved the guards' right cheeks as an insult. The king was furious when he found out the body was gone. He decided to use his daughter to catch the thief by making her work in a brothel and ask each customer about their most cunning and wicked deeds. The thief found out about this and tricked the princess by bringing a dead man's arm. When he told her his story, she tried to grab him, but he gave her the dead man's arm and escaped. The king was amazed by the thief's cleverness and offered him a reward and safety if he revealed himself. The thief trusted the king and came forward. The king admired him and gave him his daughter in marriage, saying that he was the cleverest man, as Egyptians were known for their cunning, and he was the best of them. 
122. The priests told me that this king once went to the underworld, which the Greeks call Hades, and played a dice game with Demeter. He won and lost some games, and returned with a golden hand towel as a gift from her. They said that the Egyptians celebrate a festival because of Rhampsinitus' journey to the underworld, which I know still happens today, but I can't be sure if that's the reason for the celebration.  On the day of the festival, the priests create a cloth headband and blindfold one of their members. They lead him to a road that goes to Demeter's temple, and then they leave him. The blindfolded priest is then guided by two wolves, according to the story, to Demeter's temple, which is three miles away from the city. Afterward, the wolves lead him back to the same spot where he started. 
123. These Egyptian stories are for those who believe in such tales. In this history, I write down what I've heard from everyone. The Egyptians believe that Demeter and Dionysus rule the underworld. They were also the first to believe that the human soul is immortal and that after death, it enters another living being. The soul goes through all creatures on land, sea, and air before returning to a human body. This cycle takes three thousand years to complete. Some Greeks have also adopted this belief, both earlier and later, claiming it as their own. I know their names, but I won't mention them here. 
124. The priests said that until King Rhampsinitus' time, Egypt was well-governed and prosperous. However, the next king, Kheops, brought misery to the people. First, he closed all the temples, stopping any sacrifices. Then, he forced the Egyptians to work for him. Some had to drag stones from the quarries in the Arabian mountains to the Nile, while others had to transport the stones across the river and drag them to the Libyan mountains. People worked in groups of a hundred thousand for three months at a time. For ten years, the people built a road for moving the stones, which was almost as difficult as building the pyramid itself. The road was nearly a mile long, twenty yards wide, and at its highest point, sixteen yards tall. It was made of polished stone and decorated with carvings. The same ten years were spent building underground chambers in the hill where the pyramids stand, which the king intended to use as his burial place. He even had a water channel brought in from the Nile. The pyramid itself took twenty years to build. It has a square base, with each side measuring eight hundred feet long, and it is the same height. The entire structure is made of polished stone, perfectly fitted together, with no block shorter than thirty feet in length. 
125. The pyramid was built with a stair-like structure, which some people call steps and others call tiers. Once the first level was completed, the workers used short wooden logs as levers to lift the rest of the stones. They lifted the blocks from the ground onto the first tier, and then used another lever to move the stone from one tier to the next. It's unclear whether there was a new lever on each tier or just one portable lever that was moved from tier to tier, as both possibilities were mentioned. What is certain is that the top of the pyramid was finished first, followed by the next level below, and finally the base and the lowest part. There are writings on the pyramid in Egyptian characters that show how much was spent on radishes, onions, and garlic for the workers. The interpreter told me that the total cost was sixteen hundred silver talents. If that's true, imagine how much more was spent on the iron tools, food, and clothing for the workers, considering the long time spent building the pyramid, as well as cutting, transporting the stones, and digging out the underground parts. 
126. Kheops was such a terrible person that when he needed money, he forced his own daughter to work in a brothel and charge a fee (the amount was not mentioned). She followed her father's orders, but she wanted to leave a legacy of her own. So, she asked each customer to give her one stone. They said that these stones were used to build the middle pyramid of the three, which is located opposite the great pyramid. Each side of this pyramid measures one hundred and fifty feet. 
127. The Egyptians said that Kheops ruled for fifty years before his brother Khephren took over. Khephren was very similar to Kheops in every way. He also built a pyramid, but it was smaller than his brother's. I measured it myself. It doesn't have any underground chambers, and it isn't connected to the Nile by a canal like the other one. Instead, the river flows through a constructed passage and surrounds an island where they say Kheops is buried. This pyramid was built similarly to the other one, but it's forty feet shorter in height. It's located near the great pyramid, and its base is made of colorful Ethiopian stone. Both pyramids are on the same ridge, which is about a hundred feet high. They said that Khephren ruled for fifty-six years. 
128. So, they believe that for a hundred and six years, Egypt suffered greatly, and the temples remained closed the entire time. The people despise the memory of these two kings so much that they don't even like to mention their names. Instead, they refer to the pyramids by the name of the shepherd Philitis, who used to graze his sheep in that area. 
129. The Egyptians said that the next king was Kheops' son, Mycerinus. He didn't like what his father had done, so he reopened the temples and allowed the people, who were extremely miserable, to return to their work and sacrifices. He was the fairest judge among all the kings, which is why he is praised more than any other Egyptian ruler. Not only were his judgments fair, but Mycerinus would also give gifts from his own wealth to those who were unhappy with the decisions, making up for their losses. Despite being kind to his people and behaving well, he faced tragedies, the first being the death of his only daughter. Heartbroken by this loss, he wanted to give her a more extraordinary burial. So, he made a hollow, gold-plated wooden cow and placed his daughter's body inside it. 
130. This cow wasn't buried, but even during my time, it could be seen in the town of Saïs, inside a furnished room in the palace. People offer various types of incense to it daily, and a lamp is kept lit beside it every night. The priests of Saïs said that in another room nearby, there are statues of Mycerinus' concubines. In fact, there are about twenty huge wooden figures there, shaped like naked women. However, I can't say who they are, except for what I was told. 
131. Some people tell a different story about the cow and the statues. They say that Mycerinus fell in love with his own daughter and forced himself on her. Afterward, the girl was so upset that she took her own life, and he buried her in the cow. They also say that her mother cut off the hands of the servants who had helped her father, and now their statues are in the same condition as the real women were. But I think this story is hard to believe, especially regarding the hands of the figures. In fact, we saw for ourselves that the hands had fallen off due to age and were lying at the statues' feet even during my time. 
132. The cow is covered with a purple robe, with only its head and neck visible, which are coated with a thick layer of gold. A golden figure of the sun is placed between its horns. The cow is not standing but kneeling and is as big as a large, living cow. Once a year, the cow is taken out of the chamber during a time when the Egyptians mourn a god, whose name I won't mention here. They bring the cow out into the sunlight because they believe that before she died, Mycerinus' daughter asked her father if she could see the sun once a year. 
133. After the tragedy with his daughter, King Mycerinus received a message from an oracle in the city of Buto, saying that he only had six years left to live and would die in the seventh year. The king was upset by this and sent a message back to the oracle, questioning why his father and uncle, who had closed the temples, ignored the gods, and harmed people, lived longer lives, while he, a pious man, was going to die so soon. The oracle replied that his life was ending quickly precisely because he had acted against fate. Egypt was supposed to suffer for 150 years, and the two previous kings knew this, but Mycerinus did not. Realizing that his fate was sealed, Mycerinus decided to make the most of his remaining time. He had many lamps made and spent his nights drinking and enjoying himself, never stopping during the day or night. He traveled to marshlands, groves, and any place where he could find pleasure. By turning night into day, he hoped to make his six years last for twelve and prove the oracle wrong. 
134. King Mycerinus also built a pyramid, but it was much smaller than his father's. Each side was almost 300 feet long, with a square base, and half of its height was made of Ethiopian stone. Some Greeks believe that it was built by Rhodopis, a famous courtesan, but they are mistaken. It's clear to me that they don't know who Rhodopis was, or else they wouldn't have credited her with building such an expensive pyramid. Rhodopis actually lived during the reign of Amasis, not Mycerinus, many years after these kings built the pyramids. Rhodopis was a Thracian by birth and a slave of Iadmon, son of Hephaestopolis from Samos. She was also a fellow slave of Aesop, the famous storyteller, who was owned by Iadmon as well. This became clear when the Delphians, following an oracle's advice, offered compensation for Aesop's death. The only person who accepted it was the son of Iadmon's son, also named Iadmon, proving that Aesop was indeed Iadmon's slave. 
135. Rhodopis was brought to Egypt to work by Xanthes of Samos, but upon her arrival, she was freed for a large sum of money by Kharaxus of Mytilene, the son of Scamandronymus and brother of the poetess Sappho. As a free woman in Egypt, Rhodopis was very charming and earned a lot of money, but not enough to build a pyramid. In fact, anyone can still calculate what one-tenth of her worth was, which shows that she wasn't extremely wealthy. Rhodopis wanted to leave a lasting memory of herself in Greece, so she decided to create something unique that no one else had thought of or dedicated in a temple. She used one-tenth of her wealth to make a large number of iron beef spits and sent them to Delphi. These spits can still be found in a pile behind the altar set up by the Chians and in front of the shrine itself. The courtesans of Naucratis were known to be very captivating, and Rhodopis became so famous that every Greek knew her name. Later on, another woman named Archidice also became well-known throughout Greece, though not as much as Rhodopis. After freeing Rhodopis, Kharaxus returned to Mytilene, where he was criticized by his sister Sappho in one of her poems. That's enough about Rhodopis. 
136. The priests said that after Mycerinus, Asukhis became the king of Egypt. He built the eastern outer court of Hephaestus' temple, which is the most impressive and grandest of all the courts. While all the courts have carved figures and countless architectural details, this court has even more. During Asukhis' reign, there wasn't much money circulating, so a law was made allowing Egyptians to borrow money using their father's corpse as collateral. The law also stated that if the borrower failed to repay the loan, the lender would take ownership of the borrower's entire burial vault. The borrower would then be forbidden from being buried in that tomb or any other, and they couldn't bury any of their relatives there either. Asukhis wanted to outshine all previous Egyptian rulers, so he built a brick pyramid to commemorate his name. On the pyramid, there's an inscription on a stone that says, "Don't think of me as less than the stone pyramids; I surpass them as much as Zeus surpasses other gods. They built me by sticking a pole into a marsh, collecting the mud that clung to the pole, making bricks from it, and constructing me." These were the accomplishments of Asukhis. 
137. After Mycerinus, a blind man named Anysis from the town of the same name became the ruler of Egypt. During his reign, Sabacos, the king of Ethiopia, invaded Egypt with a large army of Ethiopians. Anysis fled to the marshes, and Sabacos ruled Egypt for fifty years. During his rule, Sabacos was known for his unique approach to punishment. Instead of executing Egyptian wrongdoers, he would sentence them to build embankments in their hometowns based on the severity of their crimes. This caused the towns to stand even higher than before, as they were initially built on embankments created during the reign of Sesostris and were further raised during the Ethiopian king's rule. Among the raised towns in Egypt, Bubastis stands out, in my opinion. There is a remarkable temple of Bubastis in the town. While other temples may be larger and more expensive, none are more pleasing to the eye than this one. In Greek, Bubastis is known as Artemis. 
138. The temple of Bubastis is unique in its design. Except for the entrance, it is located on an island, with two separate channels from the Nile River flowing towards it. These channels run alongside the temple without mixing, each being a hundred feet wide and surrounded by trees. The outer court of the temple is sixty feet high and decorated with impressive ten-foot-high figures. The city surrounding the temple is built on raised ground, allowing a view of the temple from above. The temple itself has remained at its original level, making it visible from the city. A stone wall with carved figures surrounds the temple, and inside, there is a grove of very tall trees growing around a large shrine that houses the goddess's image. The temple is square-shaped, with each side measuring an eighth of a mile. A stone-paved road, about three-eighths of a mile long, leads to the entrance of the temple. This road runs eastward through the marketplace towards the temple of Hermes and is about four hundred feet wide, lined with tall trees. This is the description of the remarkable temple of Bubastis. 
139. The priests said that the Ethiopian king, Sabacos, left Egypt because of a dream he had. In the dream, someone told him to gather all the priests in Egypt and cut them in half. Sabacos believed that this vision was a message from the gods, trying to make him commit a terrible act and be punished by either the gods or people. He decided not to do it, but he knew that his time as ruler of Egypt was coming to an end. Before ruling Egypt, Sabacos had been told by the oracles in Ethiopia that he was destined to rule Egypt for fifty years. As this time period was now over and he was troubled by his dream, Sabacos chose to leave Egypt voluntarily. 
140. When the Ethiopian king, Sabacos, left Egypt, the blind man, Anysis, became king again. It is said that he had been living in the marshes for fifty years on an island he built using ashes and earth. Anysis had instructed the Egyptians who brought him food to also bring ashes without the Ethiopian king's knowledge, so they could add to the island. This island remained undiscovered until the time of Amyrtaeus. For more than seven hundred years, all the kings before him had searched for it without success. The island is called Elbo, and it is over a mile long and equally wide. 
141. The next king of Egypt was Sethos, a priest of Hephaestus. He didn't care about the warrior Egyptians and thought he would never need them. He even took away the special lands that had been given to them by previous kings. So, when King Sanacharib attacked Egypt with a large army of Arabians and Assyrians, the warrior Egyptians refused to fight. Feeling helpless, Sethos went to the temple and cried in front of the god's statue. While he was crying, he fell asleep and had a dream in which the god told him not to worry. The god promised to send him help against the Arabian army. Trusting the dream, Sethos gathered a group of Egyptians who were not warriors, but merchants, craftsmen, and traders, and set up camp at Pelusium, the entrance to Egypt. During the night, a swarm of field mice invaded the enemy camp, chewing through their quivers, bows, and shield handles. The next day, many of the enemy soldiers were killed as they tried to flee without their weapons. To this day, there is a statue of the Egyptian king in Hephaestus' temple, holding a mouse in his hand, with an inscription that says, "Look at me, and believe." 
142. The Egyptian priests shared their historical records with me, which showed that from the first king to the last priest of Hephaestus, there were 341 generations. This time period included the same number of kings and high priests. Three hundred generations equal 10,000 years, with each generation being about 100 years. The remaining 41 generations add up to 1,340 years. So, the total time period is 11,340 years. During this time, they said there was no king who was a god in human form, neither before nor after these years among other Egyptian kings. They also mentioned that four times during this period, the sun rose and set in the opposite direction than usual. However, Egypt didn't experience any significant changes in the river's produce, the land, or in sickness and death during these times. 
143. The historian Hecataeus once visited Thebes and created a genealogy for himself, claiming that he was descended from a god in the sixteenth generation. The priests of Zeus, however, did not agree with him and showed me how they traced their lineage, just as they did with Hecataeus. They took me to the great inner court of the temple, where wooden statues of high priests were displayed. Each high priest had placed a statue of himself there during his lifetime. The priests pointed to these statues and counted them, showing that each priest had succeeded his father. They went through the entire line of statues, starting from the earliest one to the most recent. When Hecataeus claimed that his sixteenth ancestor was a god, the priests disagreed and traced their lineage using their method of counting. They didn't believe that a man could be descended from a god. Instead, they traced their lineage through 345 statues, stating that each figure was a "Piromis," the son of a "Piromis." In Greek, this means a person who is good in every way. 
144. The priests explained that all the statues represented good men, but they were not gods. They said that before these men, gods ruled Egypt, but none of them lived at the same time as the human priests. Each god took turns being the supreme ruler. The last god to rule Egypt was Horus, the son of Osiris. The Greeks call Horus "Apollo." He overthrew Typhon and was the final divine king of Egypt. In Greek, Osiris is known as Dionysus. 
145. In Greek mythology, Heracles, Dionysus, and Pan are considered the youngest gods. However, in Egypt, Pan is the oldest of these gods and is one of the eight earliest gods. Heracles is part of the second group of gods, known as the twelve gods, while Dionysus belongs to the third group that came after the twelve. I have already mentioned the number of years between Heracles and the reign of Amasis. Pan is said to be even older, while Dionysus and Amasis are separated by the fewest years, which the Egyptians estimate to be 15,000. They are confident in this information because they have recorded the years in writing. The Dionysus known as the son of Semele, daughter of Cadmus, lived about 1,600 years before my time. Heracles, the son of Alcmene, lived about 900 years before me. Pan, the son of Penelope and Hermes according to the Greeks, lived about 800 years before me, making him more recent than the Trojan War. 
146. One can choose to believe any story about Pan and Dionysus, but I will share my own thoughts on the matter. If Dionysus, the son of Semele, and Pan, the son of Penelope, had lived in Greece and grown old like Heracles, the son of Amphitryon, it could be argued that they were also just men named after the older gods Pan and Dionysus. However, according to Greek mythology, as soon as Dionysus was born, Zeus sewed him into his thigh and took him to Nysa in Ethiopia, beyond Egypt. As for Pan, the Greeks are unsure what happened to him after his birth. It seems clear to me that the Greeks learned about these two gods later than the others and connected their births to the time when they first heard about them. 
147. I have shared what the Egyptians themselves say, and now I will tell what both Egyptians and foreigners report, along with some of my own observations. After the rule of the priest of Hephaestus, the Egyptians gained their freedom. However, they couldn't live without a king, so they divided Egypt into twelve districts and appointed twelve kings. These kings married each other's relatives and agreed to be close friends, without trying to overthrow or take more power than the others. They kept this agreement because of an oracle they received. The oracle said that whichever king poured a libation from a bronze vessel in the temple of Hephaestus, where they all used to gather, would become the ruler of all Egypt. 
148. The twelve kings decided to create a lasting memorial to remember their names, so they built a labyrinth near Lake Moeris and close to the City of Crocodiles. I have seen it myself, and it's truly indescribable. The effort and cost of this labyrinth surpasses all other Greek structures, even the famous temples at Ephesus and Samos. Although the pyramids are incredible and can be compared to many great monuments, this maze is even more impressive. The labyrinth has twelve roofed courtyards with doors facing each other: six face north and six face south, all within a single outer wall. There are also 3,000 double chambers, with 1,500 above ground and the same number underground. We saw the above-ground chambers ourselves, but we only heard about the underground ones through conversation. The Egyptian caretakers wouldn't show us the underground chambers, saying they were the burial vaults of the kings who built the labyrinth and the sacred crocodiles. The upper chambers we saw were truly amazing, with countless exits, passages, and courts. The entire structure has a stone roof, and the walls are covered with carved figures. Each courtyard is surrounded by precisely fitted white stone pillars. Near the end of the labyrinth, there's a 240-foot-high pyramid with large figures carved on it, which can be accessed through an underground passage. 
149. The labyrinth is incredible, and so is Lake Moeris, where it's located. The lake has a circumference of 450 miles, which is equal to the entire coastline of Egypt. It stretches from north to south, and its deepest part is 50 fathoms deep. The lake itself shows that it was man-made. Near the middle of the lake, there are two pyramids built in such a way that 50 fathoms of each are underwater, and 50 fathoms are above water. On top of each pyramid, there's a huge stone figure sitting on a throne. These pyramids are 100 fathoms high, which is equal to a 600-foot-long furlong. The lake's water doesn't come from a natural source, as the area is very dry. Instead, it's brought in through a channel from the Nile River. The water flows into the lake for six months and then flows back into the river for another six months. During the six months when the water flows out of the lake, the daily catch of fish brings a silver talent to the royal treasury, and twenty minae for each day the water flows into the lake. 
150. The locals told me that the lake drains underground into the Libyan Syrtis and stretches under the mountains above Memphis, with the inland country to its west. I was curious about where the earth removed during the lake's construction had gone, so I asked the people living nearby. They explained where it had been taken, and I believed them because I had heard of a similar situation in the Assyrian city of Ninus. In Ninus, King Sardanapallus had a vast underground treasury. Some thieves planned to steal from it by digging a secret tunnel from their house to the palace. They disposed of the excavated earth by taking it to the Tigris River, which flows past Ninus, and the river carried it away. I was told that a similar thing happened during the construction of the Egyptian lake, but the work was done during the day instead of at night. The Egyptians took the excavated earth to the Nile River, which, as expected, caught and scattered it. This is how the lake is said to have been dug. 
151. The twelve kings were fair rulers, and they eventually gathered to perform a sacrifice in Hephaestus' temple. On the last day of the feast, as they were about to pour libations, the high priest brought out the golden vessels they usually used for this purpose. However, he made a mistake and only had eleven vessels for the twelve kings. Psammetichus, the last in line, didn't have a vessel, so he took off his bronze helmet, held it out, and poured the libation with it. All the kings wore helmets at the time, so Psammetichus didn't do this out of deceit. The other kings noticed what Psammetichus had done and remembered the oracle that promised the rule of all Egypt to whoever poured a libation from a bronze vessel. Although they didn't think Psammetichus deserved to die (since they found that he had acted unintentionally), they decided to strip him of most of his power and banish him to the marshes, forbidding him from involving himself with the rest of Egypt. 
152. Psammetichus had previously been exiled to Syria when Sabacos, the Ethiopian, killed his father Necos. After the Ethiopian left due to a dream, the Egyptians from the Saïs district brought Psammetichus back from Syria. When he was king for the second time, he was banished to the marshes by the eleven kings because of the helmet incident. Feeling wronged, Psammetichus sought revenge against those who had expelled him. He consulted the most reliable oracle in Egypt, located in the town of Buto. The oracle told him he would get his revenge when he saw men of bronze coming from the sea. Psammetichus didn't believe that bronze men would actually come to help him. However, not long after, Ionians and Carians, who were on a plundering voyage, were forced to land on the Egyptian coast. They wore bronze armor, and an Egyptian brought news to Psammetichus about these armored men, as he had never seen such people before. Psammetichus realized that the oracle's prediction had come true. He befriended the Ionians and Carians, promising them great rewards if they joined him. With their help and the support of some Egyptians who volunteered, Psammetichus overthrew the eleven kings. 
153. After gaining control of all of Egypt, Psammetichus constructed the southern outer court of Hephaestus' temple in Memphis. He also built a special enclosure for Apis, the sacred bull, where it was kept and cared for whenever it appeared. This enclosure featured an inner colonnade surrounding it, adorned with numerous carved figures. The roof was supported by massive statues, twenty feet high, that served as pillars. In Greek, Apis is known as Epaphus. 
154. Psammetichus provided the Ionians and Carians, who had helped him, with places to live called The Camps, located on opposite sides of the Nile River. In addition to fulfilling his promises to them, he arranged for Egyptian boys to learn Greek from these settlers. These boys later became the ancestors of modern-day Egyptian interpreters. The Ionians and Carians lived in these settlements, near the sea, along the Pelusian branch of the Nile, just below the town of Bubastis, for a long time. Later, King Amasis relocated them to Memphis to serve as his guards against the Egyptians. It was through our interactions with these foreign settlers in Egypt that we Greeks gained accurate knowledge of Egyptian history from Psammetichus' reign onwards. In my time, the remnants of the Ionians and Carians' ship winches and the ruins of their houses could still be seen in the places they once lived. This is the story of how Psammetichus gained control of Egypt. 
155. I have mentioned the Egyptian oracle several times, and now I will provide a detailed account of it, as it is quite significant. The oracle is dedicated to the goddess Leto and is located in a large city called Buto, which lies along the Sebennytic branch of the Nile River, on the way up from the sea. I have mentioned this city before. In Buto, there is a temple dedicated to Apollo and Artemis. The oracle of Leto is housed in a magnificent shrine within the temple complex. The outer court of this shrine is an impressive sixty feet high. Among the many remarkable features of this place, one particular aspect caught my attention. The walls of Leto's shrine are each made of a single stone slab, with each wall having an equal length and height of seventy feet. Another massive slab forms the roof, which has a cornice that is seven feet wide. This extraordinary construction is truly a wonder to behold. 
156. The most incredible feature of the temple is the shrine, but there is another wonder that comes close - the island called Khemmis. This island is situated in a vast, deep lake near the temple at Buto, and the Egyptians claim that it floats. I have never seen it float or move, and I find it hard to believe that an island could actually float. Regardless, there is a magnificent shrine of Apollo on the island, along with three altars, numerous palm trees, and other trees, some bearing fruit and others not. The Egyptians have a story to explain the island's supposed movement. They say that Leto, one of the first eight gods, lived in Buto where her oracle is located. When Typhon was searching the world to find the son of Osiris, Leto hid Apollo, who was under her care, on this island, which was previously stationary. According to Egyptian mythology, Apollo and Artemis are the children of Dionysus and Isis, with Leto serving as their nurse and protector. In Egyptian terms, Apollo is Horus, Demeter is Isis, and Artemis is Bubastis. It was from this legend that Aeschylus, son of Euphorion, got the idea that Artemis was the daughter of Demeter, a concept not found in any earlier poet. The Egyptians believe that it is because of this story that the island was made to float. 
157. Psammetichus was the ruler of Egypt for fifty-three years. During his reign, he spent twenty-nine years besieging Azotus, a large city in Syria, until he finally captured it. Azotus is known for withstanding a siege longer than any other city in history. 
158. Necos, the son of Psammetichus, became the king of Egypt and started the construction of a canal leading to the Red Sea. This canal was later completed by Darius the Persian. The canal, which is four days' journey in length, was wide enough for two triremes to sail side by side. It was connected to the Nile River and began just above Bubastis, passing through the Arabian town of Patumus before reaching the Red Sea. The canal was dug in the Egyptian plain closest to Arabia, near the mountains that extend to Memphis, where the stone quarries are located. It followed the base of these mountains from west to east before turning southward through a valley and eventually reaching the Arabian Gulf. The most direct route from the northern sea to the southern or Red Sea is from the Casian promontory, which marks the border between Egypt and Syria, to the Arabian Gulf, covering a distance of 125 miles. However, the canal is much longer due to its winding path. During Necos' reign, 120,000 Egyptians died while working on the canal's construction. Necos eventually stopped the project after receiving a prophecy that he was laboring for the benefit of foreigners. The Egyptians referred to all people who spoke different languages as barbarians. 
159. Necos stopped working on the canal and focused on preparing for war. He built warships on both the northern sea and the Arabian Gulf near the Red Sea coast. The remains of the structures used to launch these ships can still be seen today. Necos used these ships when necessary and, with his land army, defeated the Syrians at Magdolus. After the battle, he captured the great Syrian city of Cadytis. In gratitude, he sent offerings to the Branchidae of Miletus and dedicated them to Apollo, celebrating his victories. Necos ruled for sixteen years before passing away, and his son Psammis succeeded him as king. 
160. When Psammis was the king of Egypt, he received a visit from ambassadors from Elis. The Eleans boasted that they had organized the Olympic games with the utmost justice and fairness, and they believed that even the wise Egyptians couldn't do better. Upon their arrival in Egypt, the Eleans explained the purpose of their visit. In response, Psammis gathered the wisest Egyptians to hear the Eleans' plans for the games and to determine if there was a fairer way to conduct them. After listening to the Eleans' explanation, the Egyptians asked if the citizens of Elis also participated in the contests. The Eleans confirmed that both their own citizens and other Greeks were allowed to compete. The Egyptians then pointed out that the Eleans' rules were not entirely fair, as they might unintentionally favor their own citizens over the other competitors. The Egyptians advised that if the Eleans truly wanted to establish just rules, they should only allow foreigners to participate in the contests, excluding the citizens of Elis. This was the counsel that the Egyptians offered to the Eleans. 
161. Psammis ruled Egypt for only six years. He invaded Ethiopia and died shortly after, leaving his son Apries to take the throne. Apries was very successful during his twenty-five-year reign, even more so than any previous king except his great-grandfather Psammetichus. He sent an army against Sidon and fought a naval battle with the king of Tyre. However, misfortune was destined to come his way. The trouble began when Apries sent a large force against Cyrene, which resulted in a significant defeat. The Egyptians blamed Apries for this loss and rebelled against him. They believed that he had intentionally sent his soldiers to their deaths to make it easier to maintain control over the remaining Egyptians. This accusation greatly angered the survivors and the friends of those who had been killed, leading them to openly revolt against Apries. 
162. When Apries heard about the rebellion, he sent Amasis to convince the Egyptians to stop. However, when Amasis arrived, instead of persuading them, he joined the rebels when one of them placed a helmet on his head as a symbol of royalty. Now as their leader, Amasis prepared to march against Apries. Upon learning this, Apries sent a respected Egyptian named Patarbemis from his court to capture Amasis and bring him back. When Patarbemis arrived and asked Amasis to come with him, Amasis rudely responded by passing gas and told the messenger to take that back to Apries. Despite this, Patarbemis insisted that Amasis obey the king's order. Amasis replied that he had been planning to meet Apries and would bring others with him. Patarbemis understood Amasis' intentions and quickly returned to inform Apries. When Apries saw Patarbemis return without Amasis, he became furious and impulsively ordered Patarbemis' ears and nose to be cut off. This act of violence against a prominent Egyptian caused the remaining Egyptians who had been loyal to Apries to switch sides and join Amasis. 
163. Upon hearing about the growing rebellion, Apries gathered his guards and prepared to confront the Egyptians. His guard consisted of 30,000 Carians and Ionians, and his royal palace was located in the magnificent city of Saïs. Meanwhile, Amasis led his forces against the foreign troops. Both sides headed towards Momemphis, ready to face each other in battle. 
164. The Egyptians are categorized into seven groups based on their occupations: priests, warriors, cowherds, swineherds, merchants, interpreters, and pilots. The warriors are further divided into two subgroups, the Kalasiries and Hermotubies, which are associated with specific districts, as all divisions in Egypt are organized by geographical regions. 
165. The Hermotubies come from various districts, including Busiris, Saïs, Khemmis, Papremis, the island known as Prosopitis, and half of Natho. At their peak, they numbered up to 160,000. These warriors do not practice any other trades and are solely dedicated to the profession of arms. 
166. The Kalasiries come from various districts such as Thebes, Bubastis, Aphthis, Tanis, Mendes, Sebennys, Athribis, Pharbaïthis, Thmuis, Onuphis, Anytis, and Myecphoris (the last one is on an island near the city of Bubastis). At their peak, they numbered up to 250,000 men. Like the Hermotubies, the Kalasiries are also dedicated solely to the profession of arms, as it is their inherited occupation. 
167. I am not sure if the Greeks have adopted this practice from the Egyptians, but I do know that in places like Thrace, Scythia, Persia, Lydia, and many other foreign countries, people who learn trades are often considered less important than others. Those who have little to do with craftsmanship and can focus on the art of war, especially free men, are highly respected. It is clear that this belief, shared by all Greeks and especially the Lacedaemonians, comes from foreign influences. In Corinth, however, artisans are not looked down upon as much as in other places. 
168. The warriors, along with the priests, were the only Egyptians who enjoyed special privileges. Each warrior was given a tax-free plot of twelve acres of land. This acre was a square with each side measuring a hundred Egyptian cubits, which is equal to the Samian cubit. The lands were assigned to everyone, but they took turns cultivating them. Every year, a thousand Kalasiries and a thousand Hermotubies served as the king's personal bodyguards. In addition to their lands, each bodyguard received a daily supply of five minae's weight of roasted grain, two minae of beef, and four cups of wine. These were the benefits given to each bodyguard. 
169. When Apries and his guards faced Amasis and the entire Egyptian army in the town of Momemphis, they fought bravely but were greatly outnumbered and ultimately defeated. Apries had believed that he was so secure on his throne that not even a god could remove him. After being captured, he was taken to Saïs, to the royal residence that once belonged to him but now belonged to Amasis. Apries was kept alive for some time and treated well by Amasis in the palace. However, the Egyptians soon complained that it was unfair to keep their king's worst enemy alive. So, Amasis handed Apries over to them, and they strangled him before burying him in his family's burial place. This tomb is located in the temple of Athena, close to the sanctuary and on the left side of the entrance. All the kings from the Saïs district were buried within the temple grounds. Amasis' tomb is farther from the sanctuary than Apries' and his ancestors' tomb, but it is also within the temple court. It is a grand stone colonnade, beautifully decorated with pillars shaped like palm trees. The colonnade has two entrances, and the coffin lies within their doors. 
170. In Saïs, there is also a burial site of someone whose name I believe it would be disrespectful to mention in this context. This tomb is located in the temple of Athena, behind and near the wall of the shrine. Additionally, there are large stone obelisks within the temple grounds, and a nearby circular lake with a stone border. This lake appears to be similar in size to the one in Delos, known as the Round Pond. 
171. At night, on this lake, they perform a ceremony about the god's struggles, which the Egyptians call the Mysteries. I know more about this, but I will keep quiet. I will also keep quiet about the Demeter ritual that the Greeks call Thesmophoria, except for the parts I'm allowed to talk about. The daughters of Danaus brought this ritual from Egypt and taught it to the Pelasgian women. Later, when the people of the Peloponnese were forced out by the Dorians, the ritual was lost, except for what the Arcadians kept, as they were the only Peloponnesian people who stayed in their homeland. 
172. After Apries was overthrown, Amasis became king. He was from a town called Siuph in the Saïs region. At first, the Egyptians didn't respect him because he was an ordinary man from a humble background. However, he eventually won them over with his cleverness and humility. Among his many treasures, he had a golden washbowl that he and his guests used to wash their feet. He broke it into pieces and made a statue of a god, placing it in a prominent spot in the city. The Egyptians started to visit and highly respect this statue.  When Amasis found out what the people were doing, he gathered the Egyptians and told them that the statue was made from the washbowl they once used for vomiting, urinating, and washing their feet, but now they greatly revered it. He said, "Just like the washbowl, I was once an ordinary man, but now I am your king." He asked them to honor and respect him. 
173. This is how he managed his daily routine: in the morning, until the marketplace got busy, he took care of any business brought to him. For the rest of the day, he drank, joked with his friends, and enjoyed his leisure time. However, his friends didn't approve of this and advised him, "O King, it's not good for you to be so casual. As a respected leader, you should be working throughout the day, sitting on a grand throne. That way, the Egyptians would know they are ruled by a great man, and you would have a better reputation. Your current behavior is not very kingly."  He responded to them by saying, "People who have bows only string them when they need to use them and unstring them when they're done. If bows were always strung, they would break and become useless when needed. The same goes for humans. If someone were always working seriously without allowing themselves to relax, they would go mad or become foolish before they even realized it. I understand this, and that's why I balance both work and relaxation." That was his reply to his friends. 
174. People say that even before Amasis became king, he loved drinking, joking, and wasn't a serious person. When his partying lifestyle left him without basic necessities, he would resort to stealing. When people accused him of taking their belongings, they would bring him to a nearby place of divination for judgment. Sometimes the oracles found him guilty, and other times they declared him innocent.  When he became king, he didn't take care of the shrines of the gods who had declared him innocent or provide them with any support or offerings, as he believed them to be worthless and their oracles false. However, he took great care of the gods who had found him guilty, considering them to be true gods and their oracles accurate. 
175. Amasis built an amazing outer court for the temple of Athena at Saïs, which was much taller and larger than any other, with huge stone blocks of exceptional quality. He also set up massive statues and large sphinxes with human heads, and brought enormous stones for the construction. Some of these stones came from the quarries of Memphis, while the largest ones were brought from the city of Elephantine, which was 20 days away by river from Saïs. The most impressive part of his work was a shrine made from a single block of stone, brought from Elephantine. It took three years and 2,000 skilled workers to transport it. The external dimensions of this chamber were 35 feet long, 23 feet wide, and 13 feet high, while the internal dimensions were 31 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 8 feet high. The shrine was placed at the entrance of the temple. It wasn't moved further inside because, according to some stories, the chief builder complained about the time-consuming and exhausting work, which Amasis took to heart and decided not to move it further. Others say that a worker was crushed by the shrine while moving it, which is why it wasn't placed inside. 
176. In addition, Amasis dedicated impressive monuments in all the other significant temples, including a huge statue lying down in front of Hephaestus' temple at Memphis. This statue is 75 feet long, and on each side of it, there are two massive statues, also carved from the same block, each standing 20 feet tall. There is another similarly sized statue, also lying down, at Saïs. Amasis was also responsible for building the magnificent and extraordinary temple of Isis at Memphis. 
177. People say that during Amasis' reign, Egypt reached its peak in terms of the benefits the river provided to the land and the land provided to its people. It is believed that there were 20,000 inhabited cities in the country at that time. Amasis also introduced a law requiring every Egyptian to report their source of income to the local ruler each year. Failing to do so or not having a legitimate source of income would result in the death penalty. Solon, an Athenian, learned about this law from Egypt and implemented it among his people. It is considered an excellent law, and may it always be followed. 
178. Amasis was a great supporter of the Greeks, and he did many things to help them. He gave the city of Naucratis to the Greeks who came to Egypt to live in, and for those who visited Egypt without wanting to settle, he provided lands where they could build altars and create sacred places for their gods. The most famous and popular of these sacred places is called the Hellenion, which was founded by several Greek cities, including Chios, Teos, Phocaea, Clazomenae, Rhodes, Cnidus, Halicarnassus, Phaselis, and Mytilene. These cities were responsible for overseeing the trading port, and any other cities claiming rights to the area were making false claims. The people of Aegina created their own sacred area dedicated to Zeus, while the Samians built one for Hera, and the Milesians for Apollo. 
179. In the past, Naucratis was the only trading port in Egypt. If anyone arrived at a different entrance to the Nile, they had to swear that it was not on purpose. Then, they had to take their ship and sail to the Canobic entrance. If the winds made it difficult to sail, they had to transport their cargo in small boats around the Delta until they reached Naucratis. This shows how highly regarded Naucratis was. 
180. When the Amphictyons needed to raise three hundred talents to complete the construction of the new temple at Delphi (since the previous one had accidentally burned down), the Delphians were responsible for contributing a quarter of the cost. To gather the funds, they traveled from city to city collecting donations. They received the most significant contributions from Egypt. Amasis donated a thousand talents' weight of a special type of earth, while the Greek settlers in Egypt contributed twenty minae. 
181. Amasis became friends and allies with the people of Cyrene and decided to marry a woman from there. He wanted a Greek wife, or perhaps he wanted to strengthen his bond with the people of Cyrene. He married a woman named Ladice, who was said to be the daughter of either Battus, Arcesilaus, or Critobulus, a respected citizen. However, Amasis found that he couldn't have intercourse with Ladice, even though he could with other women. He accused her of casting a spell on him and threatened her with a terrible punishment. Despite her denials, Amasis didn't change his mind. In desperation, Ladice prayed to Aphrodite, promising to send a statue to Cyrene if she could have intercourse with Amasis that night. After her prayer, Amasis was able to have intercourse with her, and their relationship improved. Ladice kept her promise and sent a statue to Cyrene, where it remained safe until my time, facing outside the city. When Cambyses conquered Egypt, he learned about Ladice and sent her back to Cyrene unharmed. 
182. Amasis also made various donations in Greece. He gifted a gold-plated statue of Athena and a painted portrait of himself to Cyrene. To Athena of Lindus, he gave two stone statues and an extraordinary linen breastplate. In Samos, he dedicated two wooden statues of himself to Hera, which were still standing behind the doors of the great shrine during my time.  The offerings in Samos were made due to the friendship between Amasis and Polycrates, the son of Aeaces. The gifts to Lindus were not because of any personal connection, but because the temple of Athena in Lindus was believed to have been established by the daughters of Danaus when they fled from the sons of Egyptus. These were the offerings made by Amasis. Additionally, he was the first to conquer Cyprus, making it a tributary under his rule.
