1. After capturing Babylon, Darius decided to march against the Scythians. Asia was full of people and had a lot of money coming in, so Darius wanted to get back at the Scythians for starting trouble when they first attacked Media and defeated its army. As I mentioned earlier, the Scythians controlled upper Asia for 28 years. They had come to Asia chasing the Cimmerians and took over from the Medes, who were in charge before the Scythians arrived. However, when the Scythians finally went back home after 28 years, they faced as many problems as they had during their war with the Medes. A large army was waiting for them because, while they were gone, their wives had turned to their slaves for companionship. 
2. The Scythians blind all their slaves because of the special milk they drink. Here's how they get it: they use bone tubes, similar to flutes, and insert them into the mares' private parts. Then, they blow into the tubes while others milk the mares. They believe that blowing makes the mare's veins expand and helps with milking. After milking, they pour the milk into large wooden buckets. The slaves are made to stand around the buckets and shake the milk. The top layer of the milk is considered the most valuable, while the bottom part is less valued. The Scythians blind all the prisoners they capture because they don't farm the land and live as nomads instead. 
3. So, a younger generation was born from the slaves and the women. When these young people found out about their origins, they decided to fight the returning Scythians from Media. First, they blocked the entrance to their country by digging a wide trench from the Tauric mountains to the largest part of the Maeetian lake. Then, when the Scythians tried to get through, they set up camp and fought them in battle. There were many fights, but the Scythians couldn't win. Finally, one of the Scythians said, "Fellow Scythians, look at what's happening! We're fighting our own slaves. If they kill us, our numbers decrease; if we kill them, we'll have fewer slaves. So, I think we should put down our weapons and face them with just horsewhips. As long as they see us armed, they'll think they're equal to us and our children. But if they see us with whips and no weapons, they'll realize they're our slaves. With this in mind, they won't be able to face our attack." 
4. The Scythians listened to this advice and followed it. Their enemies, shocked by what they saw, didn't even think about fighting and just ran away. So, the Scythians had once controlled Asia but were later forced out by the Medes. They returned to their own land in this manner. Wanting to punish them for their actions, Darius gathered an army to fight against them. 
5. The Scythians believe that their nation is the youngest in the world and that it was created like this: A man named Targitaüs appeared in their empty land. They say his parents were Zeus and a daughter of the Borysthenes river (I don't believe this story, but it's what they say). Targitaüs had three sons: Lipoxaïs, Arpoxaïs, and Colaxaïs, the youngest. During their rule, some golden items—a plough, a yoke, a sword, and a flask—fell from the sky into Scythia. The oldest son saw them and tried to take them, but the gold started to burn as he got closer, so he stopped. The second son tried too, but the same thing happened. Finally, the youngest brother approached, and the burning stopped. He took the gold to his house. Because of this, the older brothers agreed to give all the power to the youngest. 
6. It is said that Lipoxaïs became the father of the Scythian clan called Auchatae; Arpoxaïs, the second brother, of the clans called Katiari and Traspians; and the youngest, who was the king, of the clan called Paralatae. All these clans together are known as Skoloti, named after their king. The Greeks call them "Scythians." This is the story of the Scythians' beginnings, according to them. 
7. The Scythians believe that a total of one thousand years passed from the time of their first king, Targitaüs, to when Darius entered their land. The kings carefully protect the sacred gold and offer special sacrifices to it every year. If someone falls asleep during this festival in the open air with the sacred gold nearby, the Scythians say that person won't live through the year. As a result, they give that person as much land as they can ride around in one day. Due to the large size of the country, Colaxaïs set up three separate territories for his sons, with the largest one being where they keep the gold. The Scythians say that no one can see or travel further north of their neighboring lands because of showers of feathers. Both the earth and sky are filled with feathers, making it impossible to see. 
8. The Scythians have their own story about themselves and the land to the north. However, the Greeks living in Pontus tell a different tale. They say that Heracles, while driving Geryones' cattle, came to this land, which was empty at the time but is now home to the Scythians. Geryones lived west of Pontus, on an island called Erythea by the Greeks, near the shore of the Ocean close to Gadira, outside the pillars of Heracles. The Greeks believe that the Ocean flows around the entire world from where the sun rises, but they can't prove it. Heracles arrived in the land now known as Scythia and faced cold, frosty weather. He wore his lion's skin to keep warm and fell asleep. While he was sleeping, his horses, which were tied to his chariot, mysteriously disappeared. 
9. When Heracles woke up, he searched everywhere for his missing horses. Eventually, he came to a place called the Woodland, where he found a strange creature in a cave. This creature was half woman and half serpent, with the upper body of a woman and the lower body of a snake. Heracles was amazed and asked her if she had seen his horses. She admitted to having them but refused to return them unless he slept with her. Hoping to get his horses back, Heracles agreed. Even after their encounter, the creature hesitated to return the horses, wanting to keep Heracles with her as long as possible. Finally, she gave them back and told him that she now had three sons by him. She asked what she should do with the boys when they grew up: should she keep them with her, as she was the queen of the land, or send them to him? Heracles replied that when the boys were grown, she should follow these instructions: if any of them could bend his bow and wear his belt, they could stay in the land. However, if they couldn't meet these requirements, she should send them away. By doing this, she would be content, and his wishes would be fulfilled. 
10. Heracles gave the creature one of his bows (since he always carried two) and showed her the belt with a golden vessel attached to its clasp. After giving her these items, he left. When the creature's sons grew up, she named them Agathyrsus, Gelonus, and Scythes. Remembering Heracles' instructions, she tested her sons. Agathyrsus and Gelonus couldn't meet the requirements and were sent away by their mother. However, Scythes, the youngest, succeeded and stayed in the land. Scythes, the son of Heracles, became the ancestor of all the kings of Scythia. To this day, Scythians wear belts with vessels attached, in honor of the golden vessel given by Heracles. This is the story told by the Greeks living in Pontus. 
11. There's another story that I find more believable. It goes like this: The nomadic Scythians living in Asia were forced to flee from the Massagetae during a war. They crossed the Araxes river and entered the land that was once inhabited by the Cimmerians. As the Scythians approached, the Cimmerians had to decide how to respond to this great threat. The Cimmerians were divided in their opinions. The common people thought it was best to leave and not risk their lives for their land, while the princes wanted to fight and defend their country against the invaders. Neither side could convince the other, so they reached a stalemate. The common people decided to leave without fighting, while the princes were determined to die in their homeland rather than flee. They split into two equal groups and fought each other until all of them were killed. The Cimmerian people then buried the princes by the Tyras river, where their tombs can still be seen today. After burying them, the Cimmerians left the land, and the Scythians moved in and took over the empty territory. 
12. Even today, there are remnants of the Cimmerians in Scythia, such as the Cimmerian walls, a ferry, a region called Cimmeria, and a strait named Cimmerian. It's clear that when the Cimmerians fled from the Scythians into Asia, they established a colony on the peninsula where the Greek city of Sinope was later founded. The Scythians chased them, eventually invading Media by mistake. The Cimmerians always fled along the coast, while the Scythians followed with the Caucasus mountains on their right, eventually reaching the Median land as they turned inland. This is another story that is popular among both Greeks and foreigners. 
13. There's a story told in a poem by Aristeas, the son of Caüstrobius, a man from Proconnesus. Aristeas, inspired by the god Phoebus, visited the Issedones people. He said that beyond them live the one-eyed Arimaspians, and further away are the griffins guarding gold, and even further are the Hyperboreans, whose land reaches the sea. All these nations, except for the Hyperboreans, are constantly at war with their neighbors. The Arimaspians pushed the Issedones from their land, the Scythians did the same to the Issedones, and the Cimmerians, who lived by the southern sea, were forced to leave their country due to pressure from the Scythians. Aristeas' story doesn't match the Scythian account of this region. 
14. I've already mentioned where Aristeas, the author of the story, came from. Now, I'll share a tale I heard about him in Proconnesus and Cyzicus. It's said that Aristeas, a well-respected man in his town, entered a shop in Proconnesus and suddenly died. The shop owner closed the store and went to inform Aristeas' family. As news of his death spread throughout the city, a man from Cyzicus, who had come from the town of Artace, claimed that he had seen and spoken to Aristeas on his way to Cyzicus. The man argued passionately about his encounter. Meanwhile, Aristeas' relatives arrived at the shop with everything needed for the burial. However, when they opened the shop, Aristeas was nowhere to be found, dead or alive. Seven years later, Aristeas reappeared in Proconnesus and wrote the poem now known as the Arimaspea. After that, he disappeared once again. 
15. This story is told in two towns. I know that 240 years after Aristeas' second disappearance, something happened to the people of Metapontum in Italy, as confirmed by records from Proconnesus and Metapontum. The people of Metapontum claim that Aristeas appeared in their land and instructed them to set up an altar for Apollo and place a statue with the name "Aristeas the Proconnesian" next to it. He explained that Apollo had visited their land, the only place in Italy, and that he, now known as Aristeas, had accompanied the god as a crow. After saying this, he disappeared. The Metapontines say they consulted the oracle at Delphi about the meaning of this vision, and the Pythian priestess advised them to follow the instructions, promising better fortune if they did so. They followed her advice, and now there's a statue with the name "Aristeas" next to Apollo's image in a grove of bay trees in the marketplace. I've shared this much about Aristeas, and that should be enough. 
16. Regarding the land I've started discussing, nobody knows for sure what lies to its north, as I haven't found anyone who claims to have seen it firsthand. Even Aristeas, whom I mentioned earlier, didn't claim to have traveled beyond the Issedones, despite being a poet. He only shared what he had heard from the Issedones about the northern lands. However, I will share everything we've been able to learn for certain about the most distant lands based on the information available. 
17. To the north of the Borysthenites' port, which is located halfway along the Scythian coast, the first inhabitants are the Callippidae, who are Greek Scythians. Beyond them, there's another tribe called the Alazones. Both the Callippidae and the Alazones live like the Scythians in most ways, but they also grow and eat grain, onions, garlic, lentils, and millet. Further north, there are Scythian farmers who grow grain not for consumption, but for sale. North of these farmers live the Neuri, and beyond them, the land is uninhabited, as far as we know. 
18. The tribes near the Hypanis River are located west of the Borysthenes River. On the other side of the Borysthenes, the tribe closest to the sea is the Woodlands tribe. To the north of them live Scythian farmers, who are called Borystheneïtae by the Greek colonists on the Hypanis River (these colonists refer to themselves as Olbiopolitae). These farming Scythians live in a land that stretches east for a three-day journey to a river called Panticapes and north for an eleven-day voyage up the Borysthenes River. Beyond this area, there is a long stretch of desolate land. After this desolation, there is a country inhabited by the Man-eaters, who are a separate nation and not Scythian. Further north, there is more desolate land where, as far as we know, no human population exists. 
19. To the east of these farming Scythians, beyond the Panticapes River, lies the land of nomadic Scythians who neither plant crops nor plow the land. All of this area, except for the Woodlands, is devoid of trees. These nomads live in a region that extends fourteen days' journey to the east, up to the Gerrus River. 
20. Beyond the Gerrus River lies the region known as Royal, which is home to the finest and most numerous Scythians who consider all other Scythians as their slaves. Their territory extends south to the Tauric land, east to the trench dug by the sons of the blind men, and to the port called The Cliffs on the Maeetian Lake. Part of their land also reaches the Tanaïs River. To the north of the Royal Scythians live the Blackcloaks, who belong to a different, non-Scythian origin. Beyond the Blackcloaks, the land is mostly marshes and, as far as we know, uninhabited by humans. 
21. Beyond the Tanaïs River, the land is no longer considered Scythia. The first region belongs to the Sauromatae, whose territory starts at the inner edge of the Maeetian Lake and extends north for fifteen days' journey. This area is completely devoid of both wild and cultivated trees. In the second region, the Budini live in a land filled with various types of trees. 
22. To the north of the Budini, the land is uninhabited for a seven-day journey. After this empty stretch, and slightly more towards the east, live the Thyssagetae, a large and distinct group of people who survive by hunting. Next to them, in the same region, live the Iyrkae, who also rely on hunting for their livelihood. Their hunting method is as follows: a hunter climbs a tree and hides among the dense foliage. Each hunter has a horse nearby, trained to lie flat on its belly to stay low, and a dog. When the hunter spots prey from the tree, they shoot with a bow, then mount their horse and chase the animal, with the dog following closely behind. Further east, there are more Scythians who once rebelled against the Royal Scythians and settled in this area. 
23. The landscape of the Scythians mentioned so far is flat with deep soil, but beyond that, it becomes rocky and rugged. After traveling a long distance through this rough terrain, there are people living at the base of tall mountains who are said to be bald from birth (both men and women), have snub noses, and long beards. They speak their own language, wear Scythian clothing, and their food comes from trees. The tree they rely on is called "Pontic" and is about the size of a fig tree. It produces a fruit similar to a bean with a seed inside. When the fruit ripens, they strain it through cloth, and a thick black liquid called "aschu" is produced. They either lick this up or drink it mixed with milk. They also make cakes from the thickest residue and eat them. These people have few cattle because their land has poor pasture. Each person lives under a tree, covering it with a white felt cloth in winter, but not using any felt in summer. These people are not harmed by anyone, as they are considered sacred. They don't have any weapons of war. They settle disputes between their neighbors, and anyone who seeks refuge with them is protected. They are called the Argippeans. 
24. We have a good understanding of the land and the people living near these bald men. This information comes from some Scythians who have visited them, making it easy to gather knowledge, as well as from Greeks who live near the Borysthenes port and other ports in Pontus. When Scythians interact with these bald men, they use seven interpreters and communicate in seven different languages. 
25. We have a clear understanding of the land up to the point where these bald men live. However, no one can say for sure what lies to the north of them, as high and impassable mountains block the way, and nobody crosses them. The bald men claim (though I don't believe them) that the mountains are home to men with goat-like feet, and beyond them live people who sleep for six months of the year. I cannot accept this as true at all. To the east of the bald men, we know for certain that the Issedones live. But we have no knowledge of what lies to the north of either the bald men or the Issedones, except for what the latter report. 
26. It is believed that among the Issedones, when a man's father dies, all the close relatives bring livestock. They slaughter these animals and cut up the meat, as well as the deceased father's body, and serve all the meat mixed together for a feast. They clean and strip the father's head, cover it in gold, and keep it as a sacred relic. They perform a yearly ceremony to honor it. Every son does this for his father, similar to how the Greeks celebrate festivals for the dead. In other aspects, the Issedones are said to be a law-abiding society, where women have equal power to men. 
27. We also have knowledge about the Issedones. They share stories about one-eyed men and griffins guarding gold to the north of their land. The Scythians, who heard these tales from the Issedones, believe them to be true. We also accept this as true from the Scythians and call these people Arimaspians, which is a Scythian name. In the Scythian language, "arima" means one, and "spou" means eye. 
28. The mentioned country is extremely cold. For eight months of the year, the frost is unbearable. During this time, water doesn't turn into mud when poured out, but only when a fire is lit. The sea and the Cimmerian Bosporus freeze, allowing the Scythians living nearby to lead armies and drive wagons across the ice to the land of the Sindi. Winter lasts for eight months, and the remaining four months are still cold. The winter here is different from other places: there is hardly any rain during the rainy season, but it rains continuously throughout the summer. Thunderstorms are rare in winter but common in summer, and if one occurs in winter, it is seen as a sign. Earthquakes, whether in summer or winter, are also considered signs in Scythia. Horses can withstand the harsh Scythian winter, while mules and donkeys cannot. In other lands, mules and donkeys can endure the cold, but horses exposed to frost may suffer frostbite. 
29. In my opinion, this is the reason why cattle in Scythia don't grow horns. A verse from Homer's Odyssey supports my view: "Libya, the land where lambs are born with horns on their foreheads." This line correctly points out that in hot countries, horns grow quickly, while in very cold countries, animals hardly grow horns or don't grow them at all. 
30. In Scythia, the lack of horn growth is due to the cold. However, I find it strange that in Elis, mules cannot be conceived, even though the country is not cold and there is no obvious reason. The Eleans themselves believe it's because of a curse that mules cannot be conceived among them. To overcome this, when it's time for the mares to conceive, they drive them into neighboring countries and send the donkeys after them. Once the mares are pregnant, they bring them back home. 
31. In regards to the feathers that the Scythians claim fill the air so densely that no one can see or travel through the land beyond, I have a different opinion. In the northern part of that country, snow falls continuously, although less in summer than in winter, as expected. Anyone who has seen heavy snowfall can understand my point, as snow resembles feathers. Due to the harsh winter, the regions north of this continent are uninhabited. I believe that the Scythians and their neighbors use the term "feathers" as a metaphor for snow. So, I have discussed the most distant parts that are said to exist. 
32. Regarding the Hyperborean people, neither the Scythians nor any other residents of these lands have any information to share, except maybe the Issedones. However, I believe even they don't say anything; because if they did, the Scythians would have mentioned it, just like they talk about the one-eyed men. But Hesiod mentions the Hyperboreans, and so does Homer in his poem "The Heroes' Sons," if it is indeed his work. 
33. The people of Delos have much more to say about the Hyperboreans than anyone else. They claim that gifts wrapped in straw are sent from the Hyperboreans to Scythia. From there, each neighboring nation passes the gifts along until they reach the Adriatic Sea, which is the westernmost point of their journey. From there, the gifts are taken south, with the people of Dodona being the first Greeks to receive them. The gifts then travel down to the Melian Gulf and are transported to Euboea, where one city passes them to another until they reach Carystus. After that, the gifts bypass Andros and are taken from Carystus to Tenos, and then from Tenos to Delos. This is how the offerings are said to arrive in Delos. According to the Delians, the Hyperboreans initially sent two young women, named Hyperoche and Laodice, to deliver the offerings, along with five men to ensure their safe passage. These men are now called Perpherees and are highly respected in Delos. However, when the people they sent never returned, the Hyperboreans became upset about always sending people without them coming back. So, they decided to send the gifts wrapped in straw to their borders and asked their neighbors to pass them along from one country to the next. This is how the offerings are said to reach Delos. From my own experience, I can confirm that there is a similar custom involving offerings wrapped in straw. When the Thracian and Paeonian women perform sacrifices to the Royal Artemis, they also use straw during the ceremony. 
34. I am aware that they perform this ritual. In honor of the Hyperborean maidens who died in Delos, the Delian girls and boys cut their hair. Before getting married, the girls cut off a lock of hair and wrap it around a spindle, placing it on the tomb, which is located at the base of an olive tree to the left of the entrance to Artemis' temple. Similarly, the Delian boys wrap some of their hair around a green stalk and place it on the tomb as well. 
35. The people of Delos honor these maidens in this way. They also tell the story of two other virgins, Arge and Opis, who came from the Hyperboreans through the aforementioned nations to Delos before Hyperoche and Laodice. While the latter two came to bring tribute to Eileithyia for easing childbirth, Arge and Opis are said to have arrived with the gods themselves and received their own honors from the Delians. The women gathered gifts for Arge and Opis, singing their names in a hymn created by Olen of Lycia. The islanders and Ionians learned to sing hymns to Opis and Arge from the Delians, invoking their names and collecting gifts. Olen, who came from Lycia, also composed the other ancient hymns sung in Delos. Additionally, it is said that when the thighbones are burned in sacrifice on the altar, the ashes are scattered on the burial site of Opis and Arge. This site is located behind the temple of Artemis, facing east, and is closest to the dining hall of the people of Ceos. 
36. I've mentioned enough about the Hyperboreans, and I won't discuss the story of Abaris, who was said to be a Hyperborean and traveled across the world with an arrow while fasting. If there are people living beyond the north wind, there must also be people beyond the south wind. I find it amusing that many have drawn maps of the world, but none of them seem accurate. They depict the world as a perfect circle, surrounded by the Ocean river, with Asia and Europe being of equal size. I will briefly explain the actual size of these two continents and how they should be represented. 
37. The region where the Persians reside reaches the southern sea, known as the Red Sea. To the north of the Persians are the Medes, and further north are the Saspires. Beyond the Saspires are the Colchians, whose territory stretches to the northern sea, where the Phasis river flows into it. Thus, these four nations are situated between the two seas. 
38. To the west of this region, there are two peninsulas that extend into the sea, which I will describe now. On the northern side, one of the peninsulas starts at the Phasis river and stretches along the coast of the Pontus and the Hellespont, reaching as far as Sigeum in the Troad. On the southern side, the same peninsula has a coastline that begins at the Myriandric Gulf near Phoenicia and extends towards the sea, ending at the Triopian headland. This peninsula is home to thirty different nations. 
39. This describes the first peninsula. The second peninsula starts with Persia and stretches to the Red Sea, covering Persian territory. Next to it is the land of Assyria, followed by Arabia. This peninsula ends, not in reality but by general agreement, at the Arabian Gulf, where Darius connected a canal to the Nile. From Persia to Phoenicia, there is a large and expansive area of land. From Phoenicia, this peninsula extends along our sea, passing through Syrian Palestine and ending in Egypt. This peninsula is home to three distinct nations. 
40. Regarding the parts of Asia west of the Persians, the areas beyond the Persians, Medes, Saspires, and Colchians, towards the east and the rising sun, are bordered by the Red Sea on one side and the Caspian Sea and the Araxes river to the north, which flows towards the east. Up to India, Asia is populated, but beyond that, everything to the east is uninhabited and desolate. No one can provide information about the type of land that exists there. 
41. Asia is vast and diverse in its geography. On the second peninsula, we find Libya, which comes after Egypt. The Egyptian portion of this peninsula is quite narrow; the distance between our sea and the Red Sea is 125 miles, or a thousand stades. However, beyond this narrow section, the peninsula known as Libya becomes much wider. 
42. I am amazed by those who have divided the world into three parts: Libya, Asia, and Europe, as the differences between them are significant. Europe is much longer and wider compared to the other two. It's clear that Libya is surrounded by the sea, except where it shares a border with Asia. Necos, the king of Egypt, was the first to discover this and share the information. After completing the canal connecting the Nile to the Arabian Gulf, he sent Phoenicians in ships with instructions to sail past the Pillars of Heracles and return to Egypt through the northern sea. The Phoenicians began their journey from the Red Sea and sailed through the southern sea. Each autumn, they would stop at a part of Libya, plant crops, and wait for the harvest. After collecting the harvest, they continued sailing. In the third year, they rounded the Pillars of Heracles and returned to Egypt. They claimed (though I find it hard to believe) that while sailing around Libya, the sun was on their right side. 
43. The first knowledge of Libya was obtained in this way. The next account comes from the Carthaginians. Sataspes, son of Teaspes, an Achaemenid, was sent to sail around Libya but failed to complete the task due to fear of the long and lonely journey. He had been charged with raping the virgin daughter of Zopyrus, son of Megabyzus. King Xerxes planned to impale him for this crime, but Sataspes' mother, who was Darius' sister, intervened and suggested a harsher punishment: forcing him to sail around Libya until he reached the Arabian Gulf. Xerxes agreed. Sataspes went to Egypt, where he obtained a ship and crew from the Egyptians and sailed past the Pillars of Heracles. After rounding the Libyan promontory called Solois, he sailed south. However, after many months at sea, he turned back and returned to Egypt. He told King Xerxes that he had sailed far away and encountered a land of small people wearing palm-leaf clothing. Whenever he and his crew tried to land, the people fled to the hills. They didn't harm the locals and only took cattle. He claimed that he couldn't sail completely around Libya because his ship was stopped and couldn't move further. Xerxes didn't believe Sataspes' story and, since the assigned task was incomplete, impaled him for the original crime. Upon hearing of his master's death, Sataspes' eunuch fled to Samos with a large amount of wealth, which was later acquired by a man from Samos. I know the man's name but choose not to mention it. 
44. Asia, for the most part, was explored by Darius. There is a river called Indus, which is the second-largest source of crocodiles. Wanting to know where the Indus flows into the sea, Darius sent ships led by Scylax, a man from Caryanda, and others he trusted. They started from the city of Caspatyrus and the Pactyic region, sailing down the river towards the east until they reached the sea. They then sailed westward across the sea and, after thirty months, arrived at the same place where the Egyptian king had sent the Phoenicians to sail around Libya. Following this journey, Darius conquered the Indians and utilized this sea route. This exploration revealed that Asia, apart from the areas towards the east, was quite similar to Libya in other aspects. 
45. It is clear that no one has gained complete knowledge of Europe's eastern or northern regions, so it's uncertain if they are surrounded by seas. Europe's length is known to stretch alongside both Asia and Libya. I cannot understand why the Earth, being one, has three female names and why its boundaries are set by the Egyptian Nile river and the Colchian Phasis river (although some say the Maeetian Tanaïs river and the Cimmerian Ferries are the boundaries). I also cannot find out who divided the world or where they got these names. Most Greeks believe that Libya is named after a native woman of that name, and Asia after the wife of Prometheus. However, the Lydians claim that Asia was named after Asies, the son of Cotys and grandson of Manes, and that the Asiad clan in Sardis also takes its name from him. Regarding Europe, no one knows if it is surrounded by seas or where it got its name, nor is it clear who named it. We could say that the land was named after the Tyrian Europa, but it seems that it was nameless before that. It is evident that Europa was of Asiatic origin and never came to the land now called Europe by the Greeks, but only traveled from Phoenicia to Crete and from Crete to Lycia. I have shared my thoughts on this matter, and that should be enough. We will use the names established by custom. 
46. In the lands around the Euxine Pontus, people are generally less knowledgeable, except for the Scythians, who Darius once led his army against. We cannot find any particularly clever nation in the Pontus region, nor do we know of any remarkable individuals born there, apart from the Scythians and Anacharsis. The Scythians have made an impressive discovery in the most crucial aspect of human affairs. While I don't praise them in every aspect, they excel in this particular area: they have made it nearly impossible for anyone to attack them and escape, or to find them if they don't want to be found. Since they don't have established cities or forts and are all nomadic mounted archers, they don't rely on farming but rather on raising cattle and living in mobile homes on wagons. With this lifestyle, how can they not be unbeatable and unreachable? 
47. The Scythians have made their discovery in a land that is perfect for their needs and has rivers that support them. Their country is flat, grassy, and well-watered, with almost as many rivers running through it as there are canals in Egypt. I will mention the famous rivers that can be accessed from the sea: the Ister with its five mouths, the Tyras, the Hypanis, the Borysthenes, the Panticapes, the Hypacuris, the Gerrhus, and the Tanaïs. Their paths are as I will describe. 
48. The Ister, the largest river we know, maintains the same flow in both summer and winter. It is the most western Scythian river and the largest because other rivers contribute to it. Five rivers flowing through Scythian lands make it great: the river called Porata by the Scythians and Pyretus by the Greeks, along with the Tiarantus, the Ararus, the Naparis, and the Ordessus. The first of these rivers, the Porata, is a large stream flowing east and merging with the Ister. The second, the Tiarantus, is more western and smaller. The Ararus, Naparis, and Ordessus flow between these two and empty their waters into the Ister. 
49. The native-born Scythian rivers contribute to the Ister's size. The Maris river, which flows from the Agathyrsi, also joins the Ister. Three other large rivers, the Atlas, Auras, and Tibisis, flow north from the heights of Haemus and pour into the Ister. The Athrys, Noes, and Artanes rivers flow into the Ister from the Crobyzi's land in Thrace. The Cius river, which runs through the middle of Haemus, comes from the Paeonians and the Rhodope mountain range. The Angrus river flows north from Illyria into the Triballic plain and the Brongus river, which then flows into the Ister, receiving these two large rivers. The Carpis and another river called Alpis also flow northward from the country north of the Ombrici and join the Ister. The Ister runs through the entirety of Europe, beginning with the Celts, who are the westernmost inhabitants of Europe, except for the Cynetes. Flowing across Europe, the Ister finally reaches the borders of Scythia. 
50. The Ister becomes the largest river of all, with the aforementioned rivers and many others as its tributaries. However, the Nile has a greater volume, as it doesn't rely on any tributary rivers or springs. The Ister maintains the same height in both summer and winter, which I believe is due to the following reasons. In winter, the river is its usual size or only slightly larger, as there is very little rain in that region, but there is snow everywhere. In summer, the abundant snow that fell during winter melts and flows into the Ister from all directions. This melted snow, along with heavy summer rains, helps to increase the river's volume. As the sun evaporates more water in summer than in winter, the water that mixes with the Ister is much more abundant in summer than in winter. These opposing factors balance each other out, making the river's volume appear consistent throughout the year. 
51. One of the Scythian rivers is the Ister. Another is the Tyras, which flows from the north, starting from a large lake that forms the border between the Scythian and Neurian lands. At the mouth of the river, there is a Greek settlement called Tyritae. 
52. The third river is the Hypanis, which originates in Scythia from a large lake where wild, white horses graze. This lake is rightfully known as the mother of the Hypanis. The river's waters are shallow and sweet for a five-day journey, but after that, for four days towards the sea, they become incredibly bitter. This is due to a small but bitter spring that flows into the river, affecting its taste. This spring is located on the border between the farming Scythians and the Alazones. In Scythian, it is called Exampaeus, while in Greek, it is known as Sacred Ways. The Tyras and the Hypanis rivers come close together in the Alazones' territory, but then they flow apart, with the distance between them increasing. 
53. The fourth river is the Borysthenes, which is the second largest after the Ister and, in our opinion, the most productive of all rivers, except for the Egyptian Nile, which is unmatched. The Borysthenes offers excellent pasture lands for animals, and its fish are exceptional and abundant. Its water is sweet and clear, unlike other rivers that are murky. The riverbanks have fertile soil and rich grass in unplanted areas. At its mouth, there are natural salt deposits and large spineless fish called sturgeons, which are suitable for salting, among other wonders. The river flows from the north and is known up to the Gerrhan land, which is a forty-day journey. Beyond that, no one knows which nations it passes through, but it clearly flows through desolate areas before reaching the farming Scythians, who live beside it for a ten-day journey. The Borysthenes is the only river, besides the Nile, whose source I cannot identify, and I believe no Greek can either. As the Borysthenes approaches the sea, it merges with the Hypanis, flowing into the same marsh. The land between these rivers, shaped like a ship's beak, is called Hippolaus' promontory, where a temple of Demeter stands. The Borystheneïtae settlement is located beyond the temple, on the Hypanis. 
54. The fifth river is called Panticapas, which also flows from the north, originating from a lake. The land between this river and the Borysthenes is home to the farming Scythians. The Panticapas flows through a wooded area and, after passing it, merges with the Borysthenes. 
55. The sixth river is the Hypacuris, which originates from a lake and flows through the land of the nomadic Scythians. It eventually flows near the city of Carcine, with the Woodland and the area known as the Racecourse of Achilles to its right. 
56. The seventh river, the Gerrhus, branches off from the Borysthenes around the point where our knowledge of that river ends. It shares the same name as the place itself, Gerrhus. As it flows towards the sea, it separates the land of the Nomads and the land of the Royal Scythians, eventually joining the Hypacuris. 
57. The eighth river is the Tanaïs, which starts by flowing out of a large lake and enters an even bigger lake called the Maeetian. This lake separates the Royal Scythians from the Sauromatae. Another river, named Hyrgis, joins the Tanaïs as a tributary. 
58. These are the significant rivers found in Scythia. The grass in Scythia is excellent for raising cattle, as it produces more bile than any other pasture we know. This can be observed by examining the insides of the cattle. 
59. The Scythians have some important customs related to their gods. They mainly worship Hestia, followed by Zeus and Earth, whom they believe is Zeus's wife. They also honor Apollo, the Heavenly Aphrodite, Heracles, and Ares. All Scythians worship these gods, and the Royal Scythians also make sacrifices to Poseidon. In their language, Hestia is called Tabiti; Zeus is Papaeus; Earth is Apia; Apollo is Goetosyrus; the Heavenly Aphrodite is Argimpasa; and Poseidon is Thagimasadas. They create images, altars, and shrines for Ares, but not for any other god. 
60. The Scythians have a specific method for performing their sacred rituals and sacrifices. Here's how it's done: The animal to be sacrificed has its front legs tied together. The person performing the sacrifice stands behind the animal and pulls a rope to make it fall, while calling upon the god they are sacrificing to. Next, they put a noose around the animal's neck and use a stick to twist and strangle it. They don't light a fire, offer first-fruits, or pour any libation during this process. After the animal is strangled and its skin removed, they proceed to cook it. 
61. Since Scythia lacks an abundance of wood, the people have developed a unique way to cook meat during their rituals. After removing the skin from the sacrificed animals, they separate the meat from the bones. If they have large cauldrons, they place the meat inside and cook it by lighting a fire beneath using the animal's bones. If they don't have a cauldron, they put the meat and water into the animal's stomach and use the bones to create a fire underneath. This way, the animal essentially cooks itself, and this method works for all types of animals they sacrifice. Once the meat is cooked, the person performing the sacrifice takes the first portion of the cooked meat and entrails and places them in front of him. They use various grazing animals for their sacrifices, with horses being the most common. 
62. The Scythians have a unique way of sacrificing to Ares, the god of war. In each region, they build a large structure made of piled sticks, which is three eighths of a mile wide and long, but not very tall. The top of this structure has a flat, four-sided surface, with three steep sides and one that can be climbed. Every year, they add 150 wagon-loads of sticks to the pile, as winter storms cause it to sink. On top of this sacred structure, they place an old iron scimitar for each tribe, representing Ares. They bring yearly sacrifices of sheep, goats, and horses to these scimitars, offering even more than they do to other gods. When they capture enemies alive, they sacrifice one out of every hundred men in a different way than the animals. They pour wine on the men's heads and cut their throats over a bowl, collecting the blood. They then pour the blood on the scimitar atop the pile of sticks. Afterward, they cut off the right arms and hands of the slain men and throw them into the air near the sacred pile. The arms remain where they fall, separate from the bodies. Once this is done, they leave and continue with the rest of their sacrifices. 
63. These are the traditional rituals and sacrifices practiced by the Scythians. However, they do not use pigs for their offerings and, for the most part, they avoid raising them in their land. 
64. The Scythians have unique customs when it comes to warfare. They drink the blood of the first enemy they kill in battle. They also bring the heads of those they've killed to their king, as doing so earns them a share of the spoils of war. To prepare the heads, they cut around the ears, remove the scalp, and shake the head off. They then clean the flesh from the scalp using a rib bone from a steer and soften the skin with their hands. These scalps are used as hand towels, attached to the bridles of their horses, and are a source of pride. The more scalps a warrior has, the more highly regarded they are. Some Scythians even sew these scalps together to make garments. Additionally, many Scythians remove the skin, including the nails, from their dead enemies' right hands and use them as covers for their quivers. The human skin is found to be thick, shiny, and very white. Some even remove the skin from the entire body and carry it on horseback, stretched over a wooden frame. 
65. The Scythians have a particular way of treating the heads of their most bitter enemies. They remove the lower part of the face below the eyebrows and clean the remaining skull. If the Scythian is poor, they cover the outside of the skull with a piece of raw hide and use it as is. However, if they are wealthy, they cover the skull with raw hide, gild the inside, and use it as a drinking cup. Sometimes, a Scythian will make a cup from the head of a relative with whom they had a feud and defeated in single combat before the king. When they have honored guests, they serve drinks in these cups and proudly explain how the deceased were their relatives who fought against them and were defeated. This display is considered a sign of bravery and strength. 
66. Every year, each provincial governor in Scythia prepares a bowl of wine in their province. Only those Scythians who have killed enemies are allowed to drink from it. Those who haven't achieved this feat are not allowed to taste the wine and must sit separately, feeling dishonored. This is considered a significant disgrace. However, those who have killed multiple enemies are given two cups and can drink from both. 
67. The Scythians have many fortune-tellers who use willow wands to predict the future. They bring large bundles of these wands, lay them on the ground, and untie them. As they place each wand down one by one, they speak their predictions. Once they finish, they gather the wands and bundle them up again. This method of fortune-telling is passed down through generations. The Enarees, who are hermaphrodites, claim that the goddess Aphrodite gave them the ability to predict the future using lime-tree bark. They cut the bark into three pieces and make their predictions while weaving and unweaving the pieces with their fingers. 
68. When the Scythian king becomes ill, he calls upon the three most respected fortune-tellers, who predict the future using the methods mentioned earlier. They usually tell the king that a certain person has sworn falsely by the king's hearth, which is considered the most powerful oath among the Scythians. The accused person is then brought before the king, and the fortune-tellers claim that their predictions show that the false oath is the cause of the king's illness. The accused person, however, denies swearing falsely. In response, the king summons twice as many fortune-tellers to determine the truth. If these fortune-tellers also find the accused guilty of perjury, the person is immediately executed, and their belongings are given to the first group of fortune-tellers.  However, if the second group of fortune-tellers clears the accused of any wrongdoing, additional fortune-tellers are brought in to make a final judgment. If the majority of them find the accused innocent, the first group of fortune-tellers is sentenced to death instead. 
69. This is how the fortune-tellers are executed. People tie them up with ropes, binding their hands and feet, and gagging their mouths. They are then placed on a wagon filled with sticks. The wagon is attached to oxen, which are then driven away in a panic. The sticks are set on fire, and often both the fortune-tellers and the oxen are burned to death. Sometimes, the wagon's connecting pole is burned through, and the oxen manage to escape with only minor burns. The fortune-tellers are executed in this manner for being called false prophets. When the king orders the execution of these fortune-tellers, he also ensures that their male family members are killed, leaving no male heirs. However, he does not harm the female members of their families. 
70. When making a sworn promise, the Scythians have a unique ritual. They draw blood from the people involved in the agreement by making a small cut on their bodies with a sharp tool, like an awl or a knife. They then mix the blood with wine in a large earthenware bowl. Next, they dip weapons such as a sword, arrows, an axe, and a javelin into the mixture. Once this is done, the people making the agreement and their most respected followers drink the blood and wine mixture while reciting solemn curses. This act symbolizes the seriousness of their commitment to the agreement. 
71. The burial sites of the Scythian kings are located in the land of the Gerrhi, at the end of the Borysthenes river's navigable path. When a king dies, the Scythians dig a large, square-shaped pit in the ground. They then prepare the king's body by covering it in wax, cleaning the insides, and filling it with marsh plants, frankincense, parsley, and anise seeds before sewing it back up. The body is then transported on a wagon to another tribe. Upon receiving the king's body, the members of the tribe perform the same rituals as the Royal Scythians. They cut off a part of their ears, shave their heads, make cuts around their arms, tear their foreheads and noses, and pierce their left hands with arrows. The king's body is then taken to the other tribes under their rule, with each tribe following the procession. Once they reach the burial site in the Gerrhi territory, the king's body is placed on a couch inside the tomb. Spears are planted on either side of the body, and wooden planks are laid across them, forming a roof made of woven branches. In the remaining space within the tomb, they bury one of the king's concubines, his cupbearer, cook, groom, squire, and messenger after strangling them. They also bury horses, the first fruits of their harvest, and golden cups, as the Scythians do not use silver or bronze. Finally, they all work together to build a large mound of earth over the tomb, competing with one another to make it as big as possible. 
72. A year after the king's burial, the Scythians perform another ritual. They choose the most loyal of the king's native-born Scythian servants, as they don't have servants bought with money. They then strangle fifty of these servants along with fifty of their best horses. After cleaning and emptying the insides of the horses, they stuff them with chaff and sew them back up. Next, they attach half of a wheel to two posts with the hollow side facing up, and the other half to another pair of posts. They continue this process until many posts are set up in the ground. They then drive thick stakes through the horses' bodies, from one end to the other, up to their necks. The horses are placed on the wheels so that the front wheel supports the horse's front half, and the back wheel supports the back half, with the legs hanging freely. They put bridles and bits in the horses' mouths and secure them with pegs. Afterward, they take each of the fifty strangled young men and mount them on the horses. They do this by driving an upright stake through each body, alongside the spine up to the neck, leaving enough of the stake protruding below to be fixed into a hole made in the other stake that passes through the horse. Once they have arranged these mounted horsemen around the tomb, they ride away. 
73. This is how the Scythians bury their kings. When other Scythians die, their bodies are placed in wagons and taken to their friends by their closest relatives. Each friend welcomes the deceased and their entourage, providing a meal for the dead person, similar to what they serve to the living guests. This process continues for forty days before the deceased is finally buried. After the burial, the Scythians perform a cleansing ritual. They wash and anoint their heads, and for their bodies, they set up three poles leaning together at a point and cover them with wool mats. In the enclosed space, they dig a pit in the center beneath the poles and mats, and place red-hot stones into it. 
74. In their country, the Scythians grow hemp, which is similar to flax but much thicker and taller. It grows both naturally and through cultivation. The Thracians use this hemp to make garments that closely resemble linen. It is difficult for anyone, except for a hemp expert, to tell whether these garments are made of hemp or linen. Those who have never seen hemp before would likely assume the garment is made of linen. 
75. The Scythians take hemp seeds and, while crawling under the mats, throw them onto the red-hot stones. This creates a smoky, steamy atmosphere that is even more intense than a Greek vapor-bath. The Scythians enjoy this experience and use it as a substitute for bathing, as they don't wash their bodies with water. Instead, their women crush cypress, cedar, and frankincense wood on a rough stone, adding water to create a thick paste. They use this mixture to cover their bodies and faces. This not only gives them a pleasant fragrance but also makes their skin clear and shiny when they remove the paste the next day. 
76. The Scythians, like many others, avoid adopting foreign customs, especially those from Greece. This was evident in the cases of Anacharsis and Scyles. Anacharsis, after traveling the world and gaining wisdom, returned to Scythia. During his journey, he visited Cyzicus and witnessed the locals celebrating the feast of the Mother of the Gods. He promised the goddess that if he returned home safely, he would perform the same rituals in her honor. Upon arriving in Scythia, Anacharsis hid in a wooded area and performed the rituals he had seen in Cyzicus, using a small drum and hanging images on himself. A Scythian saw him and reported it to King Saulius. The king went to see for himself and, upon witnessing Anacharsis performing the foreign rites, killed him with an arrow. Now, when asked about Anacharsis, the Scythians claim to have no knowledge of him, as he had left for Greece and adopted foreign customs. However, according to Tymnes, a deputy for Ariapithes, Anacharsis was the uncle of King Idanthyrsus of Scythia and a descendant of a noble family. If this is true, then Anacharsis was killed by his own brother, as Idanthyrsus was the son of Saulius, the king who killed Anacharsis. 
77. I have heard a different story from the people of Peloponnese. They say that Anacharsis was sent by the Scythian king to study Greek customs. Upon his return, he reported that all Greeks were eager to learn, except for the Lacedaemonians, who were the only ones who spoke and listened wisely. However, this story seems to be a baseless invention by the Greeks themselves. Regardless of which version is true, Anacharsis was killed, as I mentioned earlier. 
78. Anacharsis faced a tragic end due to his foreign ways and association with Greeks. Many years later, Scyles, son of Ariapithes, suffered a similar fate. Scyles was one of the sons of Ariapithes, the king of Scythia. His mother was from Istria and taught him to speak and read Greek. Eventually, Ariapithes was killed by Spargapithes, the king of Agathyrsi, and Scyles became the king of Scythia. He married his father's Scythian widow, Opoea, who gave birth to a son named Oricus. Scyles was not satisfied with the Scythian lifestyle and preferred Greek customs due to his upbringing. He would often lead the Scythian army to the city of Borysthenites, who claimed to be of Milesian origin. Upon arriving, he would leave his army outside the city and enter the city walls alone. Inside, he would change from his Scythian clothes to Greek attire and mingle with the locals, following Greek traditions and worshipping the gods in the Greek manner. He would do this for a month or more before returning to his Scythian attire and leaving the city. Scyles repeated this process often, even building a house in Borysthenes and marrying a local woman. 
79. Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse for Scyles when he decided to participate in the rituals of Bacchic Dionysus. As he was about to begin the sacred ceremony, a terrible event occurred. His grand and luxurious house in Borysthenites, adorned with white marble sphinxes and griffins, was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. Despite this, Scyles continued with the ritual. The Scythians often criticized the Greeks for their Bacchic celebrations, arguing that it was unreasonable to worship a god who drove people to madness. After Scyles completed the Bacchic ritual, a Borysthenite mocked the Scythians, saying that their king had also been possessed by the god and was now participating in the same madness. To prove his point, he invited the Scythian leaders to secretly follow him to a tower. From there, they saw Scyles engaging in the Bacchic ritual, which they considered a great misfortune. The Scythian leaders left the city and informed the entire army of what they had witnessed. 
80. After this incident, Scyles returned to his own land, but the Scythians rebelled against him and chose his brother Octamasades, son of Teres' daughter, as their new king. Upon learning about the rebellion and its cause, Scyles fled to Thrace. When Octamasades found out, he led his army there. As they reached the Ister River, the Thracians blocked their path, and both armies prepared for battle. At this point, Sitalces sent a message to Octamasades, proposing a peaceful solution. He reminded Octamasades that they were related and suggested exchanging their respective family members: Sitalces would return Scyles, and Octamasades would return Sitalces' brother, who had fled to join Octamasades. The Scythian leader agreed to the proposal, and they exchanged their relatives. Sitalces took his brother and left, while Octamasades beheaded Scyles on the spot. This story demonstrates how fiercely the Scythians protect their customs and the severe punishments they impose on those who adopt foreign practices. 
81. It was difficult to determine the exact population of the Scythians, as the information I received was inconsistent. Some said they were very numerous, while others claimed they were few, referring only to the true Scythians. However, I did witness something that provided some insight into their numbers. There is a region called Exampaeus, located between the Borysthenes and Hypanis rivers, where I mentioned a saltwater spring that makes the Hypanis River undrinkable. In this region, there is a massive bronze vessel, much larger than the cauldron dedicated by Pausanias, son of Cleombrotus, at the entrance of the Pontus. To give a clearer idea, the Scythian bronze vessel can hold up to 5,400 gallons and is six fingers thick. According to the locals, this vessel was made from arrowheads. Their king, Ariantas, wanted to know the Scythian population, so he ordered every Scythian to bring him an arrowhead, threatening death to those who didn't comply. A huge number of arrowheads were collected, and the king decided to create a lasting monument from them. He made this bronze vessel and placed it in the Exampaeus region. This is what I learned about the number of Scythians. 
82. The land of the Scythians doesn't have many wonders, but it does have some of the largest and most numerous rivers in the world. Besides the rivers and vast plains, there is one particularly amazing thing to mention: near the Tyras River, there is a footprint of Heracles imprinted on a rock. It looks like a human footprint but is forty inches long. With this description, I will now return to the story I started earlier. 
83. As Darius prepared for his campaign against the Scythians, he sent messengers to gather infantry, ships, and to build a bridge across the Thracian Bosporus. However, Artabanus, son of Hystaspes and Darius' brother, strongly advised against the expedition, warning him about the difficulties of dealing with the Scythians. Despite his wise counsel, Artabanus couldn't change the king's mind, so he stopped trying to persuade him. With all preparations complete, Darius led his army from Susa. 
84. Oeobazus, a Persian who had three sons in the army, asked King Darius to allow one of them to stay behind. The king replied, "You are my friend, and your request is fair; I will leave all your sons behind." Oeobazus was delighted, thinking his sons were exempt from service. However, Darius ordered his men to execute all of Oeobazus' sons. They were killed and left behind. 
85. When Darius arrived at the place where the Bosporus was bridged near Calchedon during his march from Susa, he boarded a ship and sailed to the Dark Rocks, which the Greeks believed used to move. He sat on a headland and admired the view of the Pontus, an incredible sight. It is the most amazing sea, stretching 11,100 stades in length and 3,300 stades at its widest point. The entrance to this sea is four stades wide, and the narrow part of the channel, called the Bosporus, where the bridge was built, is about 120 stades long. The Bosporus extends to the Propontis, which is 500 stades wide and 1,400 stades long. The Propontis flows into the Hellespont, which is only seven stades wide and 400 stades long. The Hellespont then flows into a part of the sea called the Aegean. 
86. The measurements of these seas were calculated based on the distance a ship can travel in a day and night. A ship can usually cover 70,000 orguiae during a long day's journey and 60,000 at night. Considering this, the greatest length of the Pontus, from its mouth to the Phasis River, takes nine days and eight nights to travel, which equals 1,110,000 orguiae or 11,000 stades. The widest part of the Pontus, from the Sindic region to Themiscyra near the Thermodon River, takes three days and two nights to cross, which is 330,000 orguiae or 3,300 stades. These are the measurements of the Pontus, Bosporus, and Hellespont. Additionally, there is a lake connected to the Pontus, almost as large as the sea itself, called the Maeetian Lake. It is considered the source of the Pontus. 
87. After observing the Pontus, Darius sailed back to the bridge, which was designed by Mandrocles of Samos. He also examined the Bosporus and placed two white marble pillars nearby, one with Assyrian inscriptions and the other with Greek inscriptions, listing all the nations in his army. The total number of soldiers, excluding the fleet, was 700,000, including horsemen, and there were 600 ships. Later, the Byzantines moved these pillars to their city to construct the altar of Orthosian Artemis, leaving only one column with Assyrian writing beside the temple of Dionysus in Byzantium. According to my calculations, the location where King Darius built the bridge across the Bosporus was halfway between Byzantium and the temple at the entrance of the sea. 
88. After the completion of the bridge of boats, Darius was pleased and rewarded Mandrocles, the Samian architect, with ten of everything. Mandrocles used a portion of these gifts to create a painting that depicted the entire bridge across the Bosporus, with Darius sitting on his throne and his army crossing the bridge. He placed this painting in the temple of Hera, along with an inscription that read: "After bridging the fish-filled Bosporus, Mandrocles dedicated this floating bridge memorial to Hera, earning a crown for himself and fame for the Samians, while fulfilling King Darius' wishes." This served as a tribute to the bridge's builder. 
89. After rewarding Mandrocles, Darius crossed over to Europe. He instructed the Ionians to sail into the Pontus up to the Ister River, and once there, to build a bridge and wait for him. The fleet was led by Ionians, Aeolians, and men from the Hellespont. They navigated through the Dark Rocks and headed straight for the Ister River. After sailing up the river for two days, they began constructing a bridge at the narrow channel where the river's branches separate. Meanwhile, Darius crossed the Bosporus using the floating bridge of ships and traveled through Thrace to the source of the Tearus River, where he set up camp for three days. 
90. The Tearus River is considered by locals to be the best river for healing purposes, particularly for treating skin conditions in both humans and horses. There are thirty-eight springs that flow from the same rock, some cold and some hot. There are two routes to reach this river: one from the town of Heraeum near Perinthus, and the other from Apollonia on the Euxine Sea. Both routes take two days to travel. The Tearus River is a tributary of the Contadesdus River, which in turn flows into the Agrianes River, and then into the Hebrus River. The Hebrus River finally empties into the sea near the city of Aenus. 
91. Upon arriving at the river and setting up camp, Darius was impressed by the sight of it. He decided to place another pillar there, engraved with the following inscription: "The river Tearus has the best and finest water of all. Darius, son of Hystaspes, the greatest and finest man, led an army against the Scythians. He is the king of Persia and ruler of the entire continent." That was the message on the pillar. 
92. From that point, Darius continued his journey and arrived at another river called Artescus, which runs through the land of the Odrysae. Upon reaching this river, he showed a specific spot to his army and instructed each soldier to place one stone there as they passed by. After the army completed this task, he led them away, leaving behind large piles of stones at that location. 
93. Before reaching the Ister River, Darius first conquered the Getae, who claimed to be immortal. The Thracians living in Salmydessus and the region above the cities of Apollonia and Mesambria, known as Cyrmianae and Nipsaei, surrendered to Darius without any resistance. However, the Getae put up a strong fight but were quickly enslaved. They were considered the bravest and most honorable of all Thracians. 
94. The Getae people believe in their own immortality, thinking that when they die, they actually join the god Salmoxis, or Gebeleïzis, as some call him. Every five years, they randomly choose one person from their community to deliver a message to Salmoxis, informing him of their needs. The chosen messenger is sent in a unique way: three men hold lances while others grab the messenger by his hands and feet, swinging and tossing him onto the spear-points. If the messenger dies from this, they believe that their god is pleased with them. However, if he survives, they blame the messenger for being unworthy and choose another person to replace him. The message is given to the messenger while he is still alive. Additionally, when there is thunder and lightning, these Thracians shoot arrows towards the sky as a warning to their god, believing only in their own deity and no others. 
95. According to the Greeks living near the Hellespont and Pontus, Salmoxis was once a slave in Samos, owned by Pythagoras, the son of Mnesarchus. After gaining his freedom and becoming wealthy, he returned to his homeland. The Thracians were a poor and underdeveloped people, but Salmoxis had learned the more advanced Ionian ways and lifestyle from his time spent with the Greeks, especially the great teacher Pythagoras. Salmoxis built a hall where he hosted and fed the leaders of his people, teaching them that neither he, his guests, nor their descendants would ever die. Instead, they would go to a place where they would live forever and enjoy all the good things in life. While spreading this belief, Salmoxis secretly constructed an underground chamber. Once it was completed, he disappeared from the Thracians' sight and lived in the hidden chamber for three years. The Thracians missed him and mourned his presumed death. However, in the fourth year, Salmoxis reappeared, which led the Thracians to believe in the teachings he had shared with them. This is the story of Salmoxis as told by the Greeks. 
96. I'm not sure whether to fully believe or dismiss the story about Salmoxis and his underground chamber. However, I do think that he lived long before Pythagoras. As for whether Salmoxis was a real person or just a god specific to the Getae people, let's leave that question unanswered. 
97. The Getae people were conquered by the Persians and joined their army. When Darius and his land army arrived at the Ister River, they crossed it and ordered the Ionians to break the bridge and follow them, along with the fleet. The Ionians were ready to do as Darius commanded, but Cöes, the son of Erxander and general of the Mytilenaeans, asked if Darius would be open to some advice. He suggested that they should leave the bridge intact, with its builders guarding it. This way, if they succeeded in finding the Scythians and achieving their goal, they would have a way to return. Even if they didn't find the Scythians, they would still have a safe way back. Cöes explained that his concern was not about being defeated by the Scythians, but rather not being able to find them and getting lost. Darius appreciated Cöes' advice and told him to make sure to meet him when they returned safely, so he could reward him for his helpful suggestion. 
98. After saying this, Darius made sixty knots in a leather strip and called the Ionian leaders for a meeting. He told them, "Gentlemen of Ionia, I've changed my mind about the bridge. Now, take this strip and do the following: Start counting from the day I leave to fight the Scythians, and untie one knot each day. If all the days marked by the knots have passed and I haven't returned, feel free to go back to your homes. But until then, since the plan has changed, please guard the bridge and do your best to maintain and watch it. This will make me very happy." After saying this, Darius quickly continued his march. 
99. Thrace extends further into the sea than Scythia, which starts where a bay is formed on its coast, and the mouth of the Ister River faces southeast. Now, I will describe the coastline of Scythia, starting from the Ister River, and provide its measurements. The ancient Scythian land begins at the Ister River and faces south, stretching to the city called Carcinitis. Beyond this point, the coastal region becomes hilly and extends into the Pontus Sea. This area is inhabited by the Tauric people up to the Rough Peninsula, which ends in the eastern sea. The southern and eastern seas form two of the four borders of Scythia, just as seas are boundaries of Attica. The Tauri live in a part of Scythia that is similar to Attica. To help you understand, imagine if another group of people, not from Attica, lived in the heights of Sunium from Thoricus to the town of Anaphlystus, if Sunium extended further into the sea. I'm comparing small things to larger ones to make it clear. The Tauric country is like this. For those who haven't sailed along that part of Attica, you can think of it like this: it's as if another group of people, not from Calabria, lived on the promontory within a line drawn from the harbor of Brundisium to Tarentum. I'm talking about these two regions, but there are many other similar places that Tauris resembles. 
100. After the Tauric region, the Scythians live to the north of the Tauri and along the eastern sea, west of the Cimmerian Bosporus and the Maeetian lake, stretching up to the Tanaïs river, which flows into the end of that lake. It's important to note that on its northern and inland side, starting from the Ister River, Scythia is bordered first by the Agathyrsi people, then by the Neuri, followed by the Man-eaters, and finally by the Black-cloaks. 
101. Scythia is a country with four sides, two of which are along the coastline. Its borders, both inland and by the sea, form a perfect square. It takes ten days to travel from the Ister River to the Borysthenes River, and the same amount of time to travel from the Borysthenes River to the Maeetian lake. Additionally, it takes twenty days to travel from the sea inland to the territory of the Black-cloaks, who live north of Scythia. Considering a day's journey to be two hundred stades, the width of Scythia would be five hundred miles, and its length would be the same. This is the size of the land. 
102. Aware that they couldn't fight Darius' army on their own, the Scythians sent messengers to their neighboring kingdoms, whose leaders had already come together to discuss the approaching large army. The gathered kings represented the Tauri, Agathyrsi, Neuri, Maneaters, Black-cloaks, Geloni, Budini, and Sauromatae. 
103. The Tauri people have some unique customs. They sacrifice all shipwrecked men and any Greeks they capture during sea raids to the Virgin goddess. The process involves performing initial sacrificial rituals, then striking the victim on the head with a club. Some say they put the head on a pole and throw the body off a cliff near their temple, while others agree about the head but claim the body is buried instead of being thrown off the cliff. The Tauri believe that the deity they sacrifice to is Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter. When they defeat their enemies, they cut off their enemies' heads and take them to their homes. They place the heads on tall poles, usually above the smoke vent, to protect the entire house. The Tauri people mainly survive through plundering and engaging in wars. 
104. The Agathyrsi people are known for their sophistication and love for wearing gold. They have open relationships with women, which creates a sense of kinship among them, preventing jealousy and hostility. In most other aspects, their customs resemble those of the Thracians. 
105. The Neuri people follow Scythian customs. However, one generation before Darius' army arrived, they were forced to leave their land due to a large number of snakes. These snakes came from their own land and the desolate area to the north. The Neuri were so troubled by this that they left their homeland and moved in with the Budini people. Some believe that the Neuri might have magical powers. Both the Scythians and Greeks living in Scythia claim that once a year, each Neuri person turns into a wolf for a few days before returning to their human form. Although I'm not convinced by this story, people still tell it and swear it's true. 
106. The Man-eaters are known to be the most barbaric people in their lifestyle. They don't follow any laws or have a sense of justice. They live a nomadic life, wearing clothes similar to the Scythians, but they speak their own language. Among all these groups, they are the only ones who practice cannibalism. 
107. The Black-cloaks are named after their choice of clothing, as they all wear black clothes. Their customs are similar to those of the Scythians. 
108. The Budini are a large and thriving community with bright eyes and rosy complexions. They have a wooden city called Gelonus, with a wall that is almost four miles long on each side. The wall, their houses, and temples are all made of wood. They have temples dedicated to Greek gods, designed in the Greek style with wooden statues, altars, and shrines. They celebrate Dionysus with festivals and parties every two years. The Geloni people, who originally came from Greek trading ports, settled among the Budini. They speak a language that is a mix of Greek and Scythian. However, the Budini have their own language and way of life, which is different from the Geloni's. 
109. The Budini are native to the area and live a nomadic lifestyle. They are the only ones in the region who eat fir-cones. On the other hand, the Geloni are farmers who grow crops and maintain gardens. They look different from the Budini and have distinct features. However, some Greeks mistakenly call the Budini "Geloni" as well. The Budini's land is filled with various types of trees and a large forest. Within the forest, there is a vast lake and a marsh surrounded by reeds. In this area, they catch otters and beavers, as well as unique square-faced creatures. The skins of these creatures are used to decorate clothing, and their testicles are believed to cure womb-related illnesses. 
110. The story about the Sauromatae goes like this: During a war between the Greeks and the Amazons (whom the Scythians call Oiorpata, meaning "killers of men" in their language), the Greeks claimed victory and captured several Amazons. They took them on three ships, but while at sea, the Amazons attacked and killed the crews. However, the Amazons didn't know how to navigate the ships, so they were left at the mercy of the waves and winds. Eventually, they reached the Cliffs near the Maeetian lake, which is in the land of the free Scythians. The Amazons went ashore and traveled towards inhabited areas. They came across a group of horses, which they took and used to raid the Scythian lands. 
111. The Scythians were confused by the situation, as they couldn't understand the women's language, clothing, or origin. They thought the Amazons were men of the same age and decided to fight them. After the battle, the Scythians discovered that their enemies were women. So, they changed their strategy. Instead of continuing to fight, they sent their youngest men to the Amazons, guessing their numbers matched the women. They instructed the young men to camp near the Amazons and copy their actions. If the women chased them, they were to run away and return when the pursuit stopped. The Scythians hoped that this plan would result in children being born from these women. The young men followed their instructions. 
112. When the Amazons realized that the young men didn't intend to harm them, they allowed them to stay close. Gradually, the two camps moved closer to each other every day. The young men, just like the Amazons, had only their weapons and horses, and they lived by hunting and gathering food, just as the women did. 
113. When the Amazons would separate and wander alone or in pairs during midday for more comfort, the Scythians noticed this and did the same. As the women roamed alone, a young man approached one of them, and she didn't resist his advances. Since they couldn't understand each other's language, she used hand gestures to tell him to come back the next day with another young man, and she would bring another woman with her. The young man shared this information with his friends, and the next day, he and another man went to the meeting place, where they found the Amazon and another woman waiting for them. When the other young men heard about this, they also started having relationships with the rest of the Amazons. 
114. Eventually, the two camps joined together, and each man stayed with the woman he had first been with. The men couldn't learn the women's language, but the women learned the men's language. Once they could communicate, the men suggested to the Amazons that they should return to their people and live with them, promising to keep the Amazons as their wives. The women replied that they couldn't live with the men's women because their customs were different. The Amazons were skilled in archery, javelin throwing, and horse riding, while the men's women focused on household tasks and didn't participate in hunting or other outdoor activities. The Amazons believed they wouldn't get along with the men's women. They proposed that if the men wanted to keep them as wives, they should ask their parents for their share of the family possessions and then live separately with the Amazons. The young men agreed and followed the women's suggestion. 
115. After receiving their share of the family possessions and reuniting with the Amazons, the women expressed their concerns. They said they were worried and scared about living in the same land where they had caused harm and taken the men away from their families. Since the men wanted the Amazons as their wives, the women suggested that they should leave the current land and settle across the Tanaïs river. 
116. The young men agreed to this proposal as well. They crossed the Tanaïs river and traveled three days east from the river and three days north from Lake Maeetis. When they reached the region where they wanted to live, they settled there. Since then, the women of the Sauromatae have continued their traditional ways. They go hunting, with or without their men, participate in wars, and wear the same clothes as the men. 
117. The Sauromatae people speak a form of the Scythian language, but it's not the original version because the Amazons never learned it perfectly. When it comes to marriage, their custom requires a young woman to kill an enemy man before she can get married. As a result, some women never marry and grow old or die alone because they can't meet this requirement. 
118. The kings of the mentioned nations gathered, and the Scythian messengers explained the situation to them. They told the kings that the Persian, after conquering the other continent, had built a bridge across the Bosporus to enter their continent. He had already taken control of the Thracians and was now building another bridge over the Ister river to expand his rule. The messengers urged the kings not to let their people be destroyed and to join forces against the invader. If they didn't help, the Scythians would either be forced to leave their land or make a deal with the Persians. The messengers warned that the Persians were not just targeting the Scythians but also the other nations. Once they conquered the Scythians, they wouldn't leave the others alone. To prove their point, the messengers explained that if the Persian only wanted revenge for the Scythians' past actions, he would have focused solely on Scythia. However, since entering the continent, he had been conquering every nation he encountered, including the rest of Thrace and the neighboring Getae. 
119. After hearing the Scythians' plea, the kings from the different nations discussed the matter, and their opinions were split. The kings of the Geloni, Budini, and Sauromatae agreed to help the Scythians, while the kings of the Agathyrsi, Neuri, Maneaters, Black-cloaks, and Tauri responded differently to the messengers. They said that if the Scythians hadn't started the conflict with the Persians, their request would have been fair, and they would have joined forces with them. However, the Scythians had invaded Persian lands without their help and ruled over them for as long as they were allowed. Now, the Persians were simply returning the favor, driven by the same forces. The kings explained that they hadn't wronged the Persians in the past and didn't plan to do so now. If the Persians attacked their lands and started causing harm, they would defend themselves. But until they saw evidence of that, they would stay out of the conflict. They believed that the Persians were after the Scythians, who had caused the initial harm, and not them. 
120. When the Scythians received the response, they decided not to face their enemy in an open battle since they couldn't get the allies they wanted. Instead, they chose to retreat, taking their herds with them, blocking wells and springs, and destroying grass as they went. They split into two groups. One group, led by Scopasis and joined by the Sauromatae, was to retreat towards the Tanaïs river near the Maeetian lake if the Persians approached. If the Persians turned back, this group would follow and attack them. The other two divisions, one led by Idanthyrsus and the other by Taxakis, were to join forces with the Geloni and Budini. They would also retreat when the Persians approached, staying one day ahead of the enemy, avoiding direct confrontation, and following the agreed-upon plan. First, they would retreat towards the countries that refused to join their alliance, dragging them into the war involuntarily. After that, the group would return to their own land and attack the enemy if they decided it was the best course of action. 
121. The Scythians decided on this plan and sent their best horsemen as an advance guard to confront Darius' army. They also sent their wagons, which housed their children and wives, to move northward. Along with the wagons, they sent all their livestock, keeping only what was needed for food. 
122. After sending the convoy ahead, the Scythian advance guard found the Persians about three days' march away from the Ister river. They set up camp a day's march ahead of the enemy and began to destroy all living things on the land. When the Persians saw the Scythian cavalry, they followed them. The horsemen kept retreating, leading the Persians towards one of the Scythian divisions, heading east towards the Tanaïs river. As the horsemen crossed the river, the Persians followed, continuing their pursuit through the lands of the Sauromatae and into the territory of the Budini. 
123. While the Persians traveled through the Scythian and Sauromatae lands, there was nothing for them to damage, as the land was dry and empty. But when they entered the Budini territory, they found an abandoned wooden-walled town. The Persians burned the town and continued to follow the horsemen's path. They passed through this land and entered a desolate area, uninhabited and located north of the Budini. This desolate area took seven days to cross. Beyond this desolate land lived the Thyssagetae people. Four large rivers flowed from their land through the Maeetian territory and into the Maeetian lake. These rivers were named Lycus, Oarus, Tanaïs, and Syrgis. 
124. When Darius reached the desolate area, he stopped chasing and set up camp near the Oarus river. There, he built eight large forts, the ruins of which still existed during my time. These forts were all about seven miles apart from each other. While Darius was busy with this construction, the Scythians he was chasing went north and returned to Scythia. Once they were completely out of sight, Darius left the half-finished forts and changed direction, heading west. He believed that the Scythians he had been chasing were the entire army and that they were escaping towards the west. 
125. When Darius arrived in Scythia with forced marches, he encountered two divisions of the Scythians and pursued them. They always stayed a day's march away from him. Since Darius didn't stop chasing them, the Scythians followed their plan and retreated towards the lands of those who had refused to join their alliance, starting with the land of the Black-cloaks. Both the Scythians and Persians invaded their land, causing chaos. From there, the Scythians led the Persians into the land of the Man-eaters, causing more chaos, and then into the territory of the Neuri, disturbing them as well. Finally, they fled towards the Agathyrsi. However, the Agathyrsi, seeing their neighbors fleeing in panic from the Scythians, sent a messenger to warn the Scythians not to cross their borders. They threatened that if the Scythians tried to invade, they would have to fight the Agathyrsi first. With this warning, the Agathyrsi gathered at their borders, ready to stop the invaders. When the Persians and Scythians invaded their lands, the Black-cloaks, Man-eaters, and Neuri didn't resist but instead fled in panic towards the desolate land in the north. The Scythians, warned by the Agathyrsi, didn't attempt to invade their land again. Instead, they led the Persians from the Neuri lands back into Scythia. 
126. As this situation continued for a while without any change, Darius decided to send a messenger to Idanthyrsus, the Scythian king, with the following message: "You foolish man, why do you keep running away when you have other options? If you think you're strong enough to face my forces, then stand your ground and fight instead of running. But if you know you're weaker, stop this endless running and surrender to your ruler, bringing gifts of earth and water as a sign of submission." 
127. The Scythian king, Idanthyrsus, responded: "Listen, Persian, I have never run from anyone out of fear, and I'm not running from you now. I'm just doing what I usually do, even during peaceful times. Let me explain why I haven't fought you yet. We Scythians don't have towns or farmland that we're afraid you might capture or destroy, which would force us to fight you immediately. However, if you really want to provoke us, try to find and desecrate the graves of our ancestors. Then you'll see if we'll fight for them or not. Until we have a good reason, we won't engage with you in battle. Regarding fighting, that's all I have to say. As for masters, I only recognize Zeus, my ancestor, and Hestia, the queen of the Scythians. Instead of sending you gifts of earth and water, I'll send you what you truly deserve. And about your claim that you're my master, I say, 'Weep!'" This is what's known as the "Scythian speech." 
128. The messenger went to deliver this message to Darius, while the Scythian kings became furious at the mention of "slavery." They decided to send the Scythian division, which included the Sauromatae and was led by Scopasis, to talk to the Ionians guarding the bridge over the Ister river. Meanwhile, the remaining Scythians agreed not to lure the Persians any longer but to attack them whenever they were gathering supplies. So, they waited for the right moment when Darius' men were foraging and executed their plan. The Scythian cavalry always defeated the Persian cavalry, and when the Persian horsemen retreated towards their infantry, the infantry would come to their rescue. The Scythians, after driving back the horsemen, would retreat in fear of the infantry. They carried out these attacks both during the day and at night. 
129. Interestingly, what helped the Persians and hindered the Scythians in their attacks on Darius' army were the braying of the donkeys and the presence of the mules. As I mentioned earlier, Scythia doesn't have any donkeys or mules, mainly due to the cold climate. So, the loud braying of the donkeys scared the Scythian horses. Often, when they were about to charge at the Persians, the horses would either shy away in fear or stand still with their ears up, as they had never heard such a noise or seen such creatures before. 
130. In this war, the Persians didn't gain much. The Scythians noticed that the Persians were struggling, so they devised a plan to make them stay longer in Scythia and suffer from a lack of supplies. They would leave some of their flocks with the shepherds and move to another location. The Persians would then come and take the sheep, feeling encouraged by this small success. 
131. After this happened a few times, Darius became confused. Noticing this, the Scythian kings sent a messenger to Darius with a gift of a bird, a mouse, a frog, and five arrows. The Persians asked the messenger what these gifts meant, but he replied that he was only instructed to deliver the gifts and leave immediately. He told the Persians to figure out the meaning of the presents on their own if they were clever enough. 
132. Upon hearing this, the Persians discussed the meaning of the gifts. Darius believed that the Scythians were surrendering themselves, their land, and their water to him. He thought that the mouse represented a creature living on land and eating the same food as humans, the frog symbolized a creature living in water, and the bird was similar to a horse. The arrows, he believed, indicated that the Scythians were giving up their fighting power. This was Darius' interpretation. However, Gobryas, one of the seven who had killed the Magus, had a different opinion. He believed that the gifts meant, "Unless you Persians become birds and fly into the sky, or mice and hide in the ground, or frogs and jump into the lakes, you will be struck by these arrows and never return home." 
133. The Persians discussed the meaning of the gifts. Meanwhile, the first group of Scythians, who were initially assigned to guard the Maeetian lake, went to the Ister River to speak with the Ionians. They said, "Ionians, we have come to offer you freedom if you listen to us. We know that Darius has ordered you to guard the bridge for only sixty days, and if he doesn't return within that time, you can go back to your homes. So, do what will keep you blameless in his eyes and ours: stay here for the appointed time, and after that, leave." The Ionians agreed to do this, and the Scythians quickly returned to their people. 
134. After sending the gifts to Darius, the remaining Scythians gathered their foot soldiers and horsemen and prepared to battle the Persians. As the Scythian forces were getting ready, a rabbit ran out between the two armies. Every Scythian who saw it started chasing it, causing confusion and noise among their ranks. Darius asked what was causing the commotion among the enemy, and when he heard they were chasing a rabbit, he said to his advisors, "These men clearly have no respect for us, and I now think Gobryas was right about the meaning of the Scythian gifts. Since I agree with him, we need to think carefully about how to return home safely." Gobryas responded, "O King, I already knew it would be difficult to deal with these Scythians, but after coming here and seeing them toy with us, I understand even more. My advice is that at nightfall, we light our campfires as usual, leave behind those who are least able to endure hardship, and tie up all our donkeys here. Then, we should leave before the Scythians can march to the Ister River to destroy the bridge, or the Ionians take some action that could ruin us." 
135. Gobryas gave his advice, and Darius followed it when night fell. He left behind the exhausted men and those whose loss was less important to him in the camp, along with all the donkeys, tied up. He did this so that the donkeys would bray and the infirm soldiers would guard the camp, while he attacked the Scythians with the stronger part of his army. After giving these orders to those left behind and lighting campfires, Darius hurried to reach the Ister River. When the donkeys realized they were alone, they brayed even louder, and the Scythians heard them, thinking that the Persians were still there. 
136. When daylight came, the men left behind realized that Darius had tricked them. They explained the situation to the Scythians, who quickly gathered their forces, including the two divisions of their horde and the one division with the Sauromatae, Budini, and Geloni. They rushed towards the Ister River, chasing the Persians. Since the Persian army was mostly made up of foot soldiers and didn't know the unmarked roads, while the Scythians were horsemen who knew the shortcuts, they missed each other. The Scythians reached the bridge well before the Persians. Upon realizing that the Persians hadn't arrived yet, the Scythians spoke to the Ionians, who were in their ships. "Ionians, the agreed-upon days have passed, and you shouldn't be here anymore. Since fear kept you here, quickly break the bridge and leave as free and happy people, giving thanks to the gods and the Scythians. We will deal with the one who was your master in such a way that he will never lead an army against anyone again." 
137. The Ionians then held a meeting. Miltiades, an Athenian general and ruler of the Chersonesites of the Hellespont, suggested that they follow the Scythians' advice and free Ionia. However, Histiaeus of Miletus disagreed and offered a different perspective. He said, "It's because of Darius that each of us is in charge of our cities. If Darius' power is destroyed, we won't be able to rule anymore, neither I in Miletus nor any of you in other places, because all the cities will prefer democracy over tyranny." After hearing Histiaeus' explanation, everyone quickly changed their minds and agreed with him, even though they had initially supported Miltiades. 
138. The influential people in Darius' favor who voted against Miltiades' plan were Daphnis from Abydos, Hippoclus from Lampsacus, Herophantus from Parium, Metrodorus from Proconnesus, Aristagoras from Cyzicus, and Ariston from Byzantium. All of them were rulers of cities in the Hellespont region. From Ionia, there were Strattis from Chios, Aiaces from Samos, Laodamas from Phocaea, and Histiaeus from Miletus, who had opposed Miltiades' idea. Among the Aeolians, the only prominent person present was Aristagoras from Cymae. 
139. When they agreed with Histiaeus' opinion, they decided to carry out the following plan: they would break a small part of the bridge on the Scythian side, about the distance of a bowshot, to make it look like they were doing something, even though they weren't really. This would also prevent the Scythians from trying to cross the bridge over the Ister River. While breaking that part of the bridge, they would tell the Scythians that they would do everything they asked for. This was the plan they chose. Histiaeus then spoke on behalf of everyone and said, "You've come with good advice, Scythians, and your urgency is well-timed. You're guiding us well, and we're happy to help you. As you can see, we're breaking the bridge, and we'll work hard on it because we want to be free. While we're doing this, you should go and find the Persians. Once you find them, punish them as they deserve, on behalf of both yourselves and us." 
140. Trusting the Ionians' words once again, the Scythians went back to search for the Persians. However, they missed the path their enemies had taken. The Scythians themselves were responsible for this because they had destroyed the grazing areas for horses and blocked the wells in that region. If they hadn't done that, they could have easily found the Persians if they wanted to. But as it turned out, the part of their plan they thought was the best actually led them in the wrong direction. So, the Scythians searched for their enemies in areas where there was food for the horses and water, assuming the Persians would also head to such places while fleeing. But the Persians followed their own previous tracks, and after much difficulty, they found the crossing. When they arrived at night and saw the broken bridge, they became very worried that the Ionians had left them behind. 
141. Darius had an Egyptian with him who had the loudest voice in the world. He asked this man to stand on the bank of the Ister River and call out to Histiaeus the Milesian. The Egyptian did as he was told, and Histiaeus heard him on the first shout. In response, Histiaeus sent all the ships to help the army cross the river and fixed the broken bridge. 
142. The Persians managed to escape. The Scythians tried to find them but missed them once again. The Scythians' opinion of the Ionians was that if they were considered free men, they were the most cowardly and dishonorable in the world. However, if they were seen as slaves, no one loved their masters more or had less desire to break free. This is how the Scythians mocked the Ionians. 
143. Darius marched through Thrace and arrived at Sestos on the Chersonesus peninsula. From there, he crossed over to Asia on his ships, leaving Megabazus in charge of his forces in Europe. Megabazus was a Persian whom Darius had once honored with a remark among the Persians, which I will mention here: Darius was about to eat a pomegranate, and as soon as he opened the first one, his brother Artabanus asked him what he would like to have as many of as there were seeds in the pomegranate. Darius replied that he would rather have that many men like Megabazus than conquer all of Hellas. By saying this among the Persians, the king showed great respect for Megabazus. Now, Darius left him as the commander, leading eighty thousand of his soldiers. 
144. Megabazus is well-known among the people of the Hellespont for his response when he was told in Byzantium that the people of Calchedon had founded their town seventeen years before the Byzantines had founded theirs. He said that the Calchedonians must have been blind at that time, because if they weren't, they wouldn't have chosen a worse location for their city when they could have had a better one. Now, as the commander left in the region, Megabazus conquered all the people of the Hellespont who did not support the Persians. 
145. At the same time, another large force was sent to Libya for reasons I will explain after finishing the story I am about to tell. The descendants of the Argo crew were expelled by the Pelasgians, who had kidnapped Athenian women from Brauron. After being driven out of Lemnos, they sailed to Lacedaemon and set up camp on Teügetum, where they started a fire. Seeing this, the Lacedaemonians sent a messenger to ask who they were and where they came from. The Minyae replied that they were descendants of the heroes who had sailed on the Argo and landed in Lemnos, where they had started their lineage. Upon hearing the Minyae's story, the Lacedaemonians sent another messenger to ask why they had come to Laconia and started a fire. The Minyae explained that they had been expelled by the Pelasgians and had come to their ancestors' land, seeking to live with their fathers' people, share their rights, and receive land. The Lacedaemonians gladly welcomed the Minyae on the terms they requested, mainly because the Tyndaridae had been part of the Argo's crew. They gave the Minyae land and integrated them into their tribes. The Minyae quickly married and arranged marriages for the women they had brought from Lemnos. 
146. However, it didn't take long for the Minyae to become demanding, seeking equal rights to the kingship and committing other disrespectful acts. As a result, the Lacedaemonians decided to kill them. They captured the Minyae and threw them into prison. (When the Lacedaemonians carry out executions, they do so at night, never during the day.) As they were about to execute the prisoners, the Minyae's wives, who were local women and daughters of prominent Spartans, asked for permission to visit their husbands in prison. The Lacedaemonians allowed this, not suspecting any deceit from the women. When the wives entered the prison, they exchanged clothes with their husbands, giving them their own garments and putting on the men's clothing. The Minyae then escaped, disguised as women wearing women's clothes, and once again set up camp on Teügetum. 
147. Around the same time, Theras, a descendant of Polynices through Thersander, Tisamenus, and Autesion, was planning to lead a group of colonists from Lacedaemon. Theras belonged to the Cadmus family line and was the maternal uncle of Aristodemus' sons, Eurysthenes and Procles. While the boys were still young, Theras held the royal power of Sparta as a regent. However, when his nephews grew up and became kings, Theras couldn't bear being a subject after experiencing supreme power. He decided he would no longer stay in Lacedaemon and would sail away to join his family. On the island now known as Thera, but previously called Calliste, there were descendants of Membliarus, the son of Poeciles, a Phoenician. Cadmus, the son of Agenor, had landed on the island during his search for Europa. He either liked the land or had another reason to stay, so he left his relative Membliarus and other Phoenicians on the island. These people lived on the island of Calliste for eight generations before Theras arrived from Lacedaemon. 
148. Theras was preparing to join these people on the island, taking a group of people from various tribes with him. His plan was to settle among the people of Calliste without driving them out, and to consider them as his own people. Meanwhile, the Minyae had escaped from prison and set up camp on Teügetum. The Lacedaemonians were planning to execute them, but Theras intervened, promising to lead them out of the country himself to avoid any bloodshed. The Lacedaemonians agreed to this proposal. Theras then sailed with three thirty-oared ships to join the descendants of Membliarus, taking with him only a few of the Minyae. The majority of the Minyae went to the lands of the Paroreatae and Caucones, driving them out of their own territory. They then divided themselves into six groups and established the cities of Lepreum, Macistus, Phrixae, Pyrgus, Epium, and Nudium in the conquered land. Most of these cities were later captured and destroyed by the Eleans during my time. As for the island of Calliste, it was renamed Thera after its new colonist, Theras. 
149. However, Theras' son refused to sail with him. His father then said that he would leave him behind like a sheep among wolves. After this remark, the boy was nicknamed Oeolycus, which eventually became his common name. He had a son named Aegeus, from whom the Aegidae, a prominent Spartan clan, took their name.  The men of this clan noticed that none of their children survived, so they built a temple dedicated to the avenging spirits of Laïus and Oedipus, following the guidance of an oracle. After doing this, their children began to live. The same situation occurred with the children of the Aegidae on the island of Thera. 
150. The story so far is consistent between the records of Lacedaemon and Thera. The rest of the story comes only from the Theraeans. Grinnus, the son of Aesanius and king of Thera, who was a descendant of Theras, visited Delphi with a group of people, including Battus, the son of Polymnestus. Battus was a descendant of Euphemus from the Minyan clan. Grinnus brought a hecatomb as an offering from his city. When Grinnus asked the oracle about various matters, the priestess told him to establish a city in Libya. Grinnus replied, "Lord, I am too old and heavy to move; please command one of these younger men to do this," pointing to Battus as he spoke. Nothing more was said at that time. However, when they left, they did not follow the oracle's instructions because they didn't know where Libya was and were afraid to send a colony to an unknown location. 
151. Seven years after their visit to Delphi, Thera experienced a severe drought with no rain, causing all the trees on the island to wither except for one. The Theraeans consulted the oracle at Delphi again, and the priestess reminded them about the colony they were supposed to establish in Libya. Realizing that they had no other solution to their problems, they decided to send messengers to Crete to find someone who had been to Libya. While traveling around Crete, the messengers arrived at the town of Itanus, where they met a murex fisherman named Corobius. He told them that he had once been blown off course by strong winds and ended up in Libya, on an island called Platea. The messengers brought Corobius back to Thera with them, and then a small group was sent on a ship to explore the land. Guided by Corobius, they reached the island of Platea, where they left him with enough supplies for a few months. The explorers then quickly returned to Thera to report their findings about the island. 
152. After being away for longer than planned, Corobius ran out of provisions. A Samian ship, captained by Colaeus and bound for Egypt, was blown off course and ended up at Platea. The Samians learned about Corobius's situation and provided him with enough supplies for a year. They then attempted to sail to Egypt, but an easterly wind pushed them off course, taking them through the Pillars of Heracles and eventually to Tartessus. At that time, Tartessus was an untapped market, so the Samians made a significant profit from their goods, second only to Sostratus of Aegina. The Samians used a tenth of their profit, six talents, to create a bronze vessel resembling an Argolic cauldron, adorned with griffin heads around the rim. They placed this vessel in their temple of Hera, supported by three colossal bronze figures, each twelve feet high and kneeling. This event marked the beginning of a close friendship between the Samians and the people of Cyrene and Thera. 
153. When the explorers returned to Thera after leaving Corobius on the island, they reported that they had found a suitable island near Libya for a settlement. The Theraeans decided to send people from their seven regions, selecting one brother from each pair by drawing lots. They appointed Battus as the leader and king of the new colony. They then prepared two fifty-oared ships and sent them to the island of Platea. 
154. The following story is where the Theraean and Cyrenaean accounts agree, but the Cyrenaeans have a different tale about Battus. In Crete, there was a town called Oaxus, ruled by a man named Etearchus. He had a daughter named Phronime from his first marriage and later married a second wife. The stepmother treated Phronime poorly, accusing her of immoral behavior and convincing Etearchus that the accusations were true. Etearchus decided to commit a terrible act against his daughter. A Theraean trader named Themison was visiting Oaxus, and Etearchus befriended him, making him promise to do whatever Etearchus asked. Etearchus then handed over his daughter to Themison, instructing him to take her away and throw her into the sea. Themison was furious at being deceived in this way and ended his friendship with Etearchus. However, to fulfill his oath, Themison took Phronime on his ship, lowered her into the sea with ropes, and then pulled her back up. Eventually, they arrived at Thera. 
155. In Thera, a prominent man named Polymnestus took Phronime as his concubine. They had a son who had a speech impediment and stuttered. According to the Theraeans and Cyrenaeans, they named him Battus. However, it is likely that he was given a different name initially and adopted the name Battus when he arrived in Libya, due to an oracle given to him at Delphi and the prestigious position he received. The Libyan word for king is "Battus," which is probably why the Pythian priestess used this name in her prophecy, knowing he would become a king in Libya. When Battus grew up, he visited Delphi to ask about his speech problem. The priestess responded with a prophecy: "Battus, you have come for a voice; but Lord Phoebus Apollo sends you to found a city in Libya, the land of sheep." It was as if she called him "king" in Greek, saying, "Basileus, you have come for a voice," and so on. Battus replied, "Lord, I came to ask about my speech, but you speak of other matters, impossible tasks. You tell me to establish a colony in Libya; how can I find the power or strength for that?" Since the god would not provide another oracle and kept repeating the same message, Battus left while the priestess was still speaking and returned to Thera. 
156. Things eventually took a turn for the worse for Battus and the Theraeans. Unsure of the cause of their troubles, they consulted the oracle at Delphi. The priestess told them that their situation would improve if they helped Battus establish a colony in Cyrene, Libya. So, the Theraeans sent Battus with two fifty-oared ships to Libya. However, not knowing what to do next, they soon returned to Thera. Upon their return, the Theraeans shot arrows at them, refusing to let the ships dock and demanding they sail back to Libya. Left with no choice, they returned to Libya and settled on an island off the coast called Platea, which was mentioned earlier. The island is said to be as large as the city of Cyrene is now. 
157. After living on the island for two years and facing continuous hardships, the settlers decided to consult the oracle at Delphi once again, leaving one person behind. They told the priestess that they were living in Libya but were still struggling. The priestess responded, "If you think you know Libya, the land of sheep, better than I do, even though I have been there and you have not, then I am truly amazed by your knowledge." Upon hearing this, Battus and his companions realized they had no choice but to settle in Libya itself. They returned to the island, picked up the person they had left behind, and established a settlement on the Libyan mainland, across from the island, in a place called Aziris. This location was surrounded by beautiful groves on both sides, with a river flowing along one side. 
158. The settlers lived in Aziris for six years. In the seventh year, the Libyans convinced them to move to a better location. They guided the Greeks westward, timing their journey so that they would pass the most beautiful place in Libya, called Irasa, during the night, to prevent them from seeing it. Eventually, they brought the Greeks to a place known as the Fountain of Apollo and told them, "This is the right place for you to live, Greeks, for here the sky is torn." 
159. During the reigns of Battus, the founder of the colony who ruled for forty years, and his son Arcesilaus who ruled for sixteen years, the population of Cyrene did not grow significantly. However, during the time of the third ruler, also named Battus and known as the Fortunate, the Pythian priestess encouraged all Greeks to move to Libya and join the Cyrenaeans, who promised to distribute land among them. The oracle warned that those who hesitated would regret it later. As a result, a large number of Greeks moved to Cyrene, taking vast areas of land from the neighboring Libyans. The Libyans, feeling mistreated and robbed of their lands, sought help from the Egyptian king, Apries. Apries sent a large Egyptian army to fight against the Cyrenaeans. The Cyrenaeans met the Egyptians at Irasa and the Thestes spring, where they defeated them. The Egyptians, having little experience with Greeks and underestimating their opponents, suffered a significant loss, with only a few soldiers returning to Egypt. This defeat led to a rebellion against King Apries in Egypt, as the Egyptians blamed him for the disaster. 
160. Battus had a son named Arcesilaus who, upon becoming king, had a disagreement with his brothers. This led them to leave him and establish a new city in Libya called Barce. While founding the city, they convinced the Libyans to rebel against the Cyrenaeans. In response, Arcesilaus led an army against the Libyans who had welcomed his brothers and joined the revolt. The Libyans fled to the eastern part of the country, with Arcesilaus pursuing them until they reached a place called Leucon. There, the Libyans decided to fight back, and they defeated the Cyrenaeans, killing seven thousand of their soldiers. Following this defeat, Arcesilaus became weak and was eventually strangled by his brother Learchus after taking a drug. In turn, Learchus was cunningly killed by Arcesilaus' wife, Eryxo. 
161. The kingship of Arcesilaus was passed on to his son Battus, who had difficulty walking due to a disability. In light of the troubles they had faced, the Cyrenaeans consulted the oracle at Delphi to find out the best way to govern their society. The priestess advised them to bring a mediator from Mantinea in Arcadia. Following the advice, the Cyrenaeans requested help from the Mantineans, who sent their most respected citizen, Demonax. Upon arriving in Cyrene and understanding the situation, Demonax divided the people into three tribes: one consisting of Theraeans and displaced Libyans, the second made up of Peloponnesians and Cretans, and the third comprising all the islanders. He also allocated specific lands and religious roles to their king Battus, while the rest of the resources, which had previously belonged to the kings, were to be shared among the people. 
162. During Battus' lifetime, the new rules established by Demonax were followed. However, when his son Arcesilaus took over, conflicts arose regarding the king's rights. Arcesilaus, the son of the disabled Battus and Pheretime, refused to follow Demonax's rules and demanded the return of his ancestors' privileges. He formed a faction to support his cause but was defeated and exiled to Samos, while his mother fled to Salamis in Cyprus. At that time, Salamis was ruled by Evelthon, who had gifted a magnificent censer to Delphi, which is now housed in the Corinthians' treasury. Pheretime approached Evelthon, asking for an army to help her and her son regain control of Cyrene. Evelthon offered her various gifts but refused to provide an army. With each gift, Pheretime would say that it was nice, but an army would be better. Finally, Evelthon sent her a golden spindle, distaff, and wool. When Pheretime repeated her usual response, he told her that these items, not armies, were suitable gifts for women. 
163. While Arcesilaus was in Samos, he gathered as many men as he could, promising them a new distribution of land. As a large army assembled, he visited Delphi to ask the oracle about his return to power. The priestess provided the following response: Loxias, the god of prophecy, grants your family the kingship of Cyrene for the lifetimes of four Battuses and four Arcesilauses, totaling eight generations. Do not attempt to extend this rule further. You may return to your homeland and live peacefully. However, if you find an oven filled with amphora, do not bake them; let them remain unharmed. If you do bake them, avoid entering the tidal place, for doing so will result in your death and the death of the most beautiful bull in the herd. This was the oracle's message to Arcesilaus. 
164. Arcesilaus returned to Cyrene with the men from Samos and took control of the city. However, he ignored the oracle's advice and sought revenge on his enemies for his exile. Some of them fled the country, while others were captured by Arcesilaus and sent to Cyprus to be executed. These prisoners were diverted to Cnidus, where the Cnidians saved them and sent them to Thera. Other Cyrenaeans sought refuge in a large tower owned by a man named Aglomachus. Arcesilaus surrounded the tower with wood and burned them alive. Only then did Arcesilaus realize that this was the meaning of the Delphic oracle's warning not to bake the amphora if he found them in the oven. Fearing the prophesied death, he avoided entering the city of Cyrene, believing it to be the tidal place mentioned in the oracle. Arcesilaus was married to a relative, the daughter of Alazir, the king of the Barcaeans. He went to visit Alazir, but conspirators from Barce and exiled Cyrenaeans discovered his presence and killed both him and his father-in-law while they were walking in the town. In this way, Arcesilaus, whether intentionally or not, misunderstood the oracle's message and ultimately met his fate. 
165. While Arcesilaus was in Barce, leading himself to his own demise, his mother Pheretime managed his affairs in Cyrene. She took care of his business and participated in council meetings. However, when she learned about her son's death in Barce, she fled to Egypt, relying on the good relationship Arcesilaus had established with Cambyses, the son of Cyrus. Arcesilaus was the one who had offered Cyrene to Cambyses and agreed to pay tribute. Upon arriving in Egypt, Pheretime sought help from Aryandes, asking him to avenge her son's death. She argued that her son had been killed because of his alliance with the Medes. 
166. Aryandes had been appointed as the governor of Egypt by Cambyses. Later on, he was executed for trying to make himself equal to Darius. Aryandes learned that Darius wanted to create a unique legacy that no other king had ever achieved. So, he decided to imitate Darius' actions, which eventually led to his punishment. Darius had minted gold coins of extremely high purity, and Aryandes, while ruling Egypt, did the same with silver coins. To this day, no silver coins are as pure as those made by Aryandes. However, when Darius found out about Aryandes' actions, he executed him, not for copying his idea, but for being a rebel. 
167. Aryandes felt sympathy for Pheretime and provided her with both Egyptian land and sea forces. He appointed Amasis, a Maraphian, as the army's general, and Badres from the Pasargadae tribe as the admiral of the fleet. Before sending the troops, Aryandes asked the people of Barce who had killed Arcesilaus. The Barcaeans replied that the entire city was responsible due to the numerous wrongs Arcesilaus had committed against them. Upon hearing this, Aryandes sent his troops along with Pheretime. Although this was the official reason, I believe the real purpose of sending the troops was to conquer Libya. There are many different tribes in Libya, and while a few of them were subjects of the king, most of them did not care about Darius. 
168. In Libya, the Adyrmachidae people live closest to Egypt. They mostly follow Egyptian customs but dress like other Libyans. Their women wear twisted bronze decorations on both legs and have long hair. They are the only Libyans who catch lice from their hair, bite them, and then throw them away. They also present all their virgins who are about to get married to the king. The king then chooses and takes the virginity of any of these young women that he likes. The Adyrmachidae territory stretches from Egypt to a harbor called Plynus. 
169. Next to the Adyrmachidae are the Giligamae people, who live in the western region up to the island of Aphrodisias. Between their territory and the Adyrmachidae's land lies the island of Platea, which was colonized by the Cyrenaeans. On the mainland, there is a harbor called Menelaus and a settlement called Aziris, also established by the Cyrenaeans. The silphium-producing region starts here and extends from the island of Platea to the entrance of the Syrtis. The customs of the Giligamae people are similar to those of the other Libyan tribes. 
170. To the west of the Giligamae are the Asbystae people, who live inland from Cyrene and do not extend to the coast, as that area belongs to the Cyrenaeans. The Asbystae are known for using four-horse chariots more than any other Libyan tribe. They also tend to adopt many of the Cyrenaean customs. 
171. To the west of the Asbystae are the Auschisae people, who live inland from Barce and reach the coast at Euhesperidae. In the middle of the Auschisae territory, there is a small tribe called the Bacales, whose land extends to the coastal town of Tauchira in the Barcaean region. The customs of the Bacales are similar to those of the people living inland from Cyrene. 
172. To the west of the Auschisae is the densely populated land of the Nasamones. During summer, they leave their flocks by the sea and travel to the Augila region to collect dates from the abundant palm trees that bear fruit there. They also hunt locusts, which they dry in the sun, grind, and mix with milk to drink. Nasamones men typically have multiple wives, and their relationships with women are quite casual, similar to the Massagetae people. When a man visits a woman, he places a staff outside her dwelling to indicate their intimate encounter. On a Nasamones wedding night, the bride must sleep with each male guest in turn, and each man gives her a gift from his home afterward. When swearing oaths or seeking divination, the Nasamones place their hands on the graves of the most just and good men among them and swear by these men. For divination, they visit their ancestors' tombs, pray, and then sleep there, interpreting any dreams they have as oracles. When exchanging promises, they drink from each other's hands. If no liquid is available, they take some dust from the ground and lick it as a symbol of their commitment. 
173. The Psylli people used to live near the Nasamones, but they were wiped out due to a tragic event. Their water sources dried up because of the strong south wind, leaving their land, which was located near the Syrtis region, without water. According to the Libyans, the Psylli decided to head south in search of water. However, while they were in the sandy desert, a powerful south wind engulfed them, leading to their complete destruction. As a result, the Nasamones took over their land. 
174. To the south of these people, the Garamantes live in a region filled with wild animals. They avoid contact and interaction with other humans. They don't possess any weapons for war and don't know how to protect themselves. 
175. The people living inland of the Nasamones are the Macae. They have a unique hairstyle where they shave the sides of their heads and leave a crest of hair on top. In battle, they use shields made from ostrich skins. The Cinyps River flows through their land, originating from a densely wooded hill called the Hill of the Graces. This hill is located 25 miles from the sea and is an exception to the otherwise treeless landscape of the Libyan region I've mentioned before. 
176. Adjacent to the Macae are the Gindanes people. In their culture, women wear multiple leather anklets, with each anklet representing a man they have been intimate with. The more anklets a woman wears, the more highly regarded she is, as it signifies that she has been loved by many men. 
177. A peninsula extends into the sea within the land of the Gindanes, and this is where the Lotus Eaters reside. Their primary food source is the lotus fruit. This fruit, similar in size to a mastich-berry, has a sweet taste resembling that of a date-palm fruit. The Lotus Eaters not only consume the fruit but also make wine from it. 
178. Following the coastline, next to the Lotus Eaters, are the Machlyes. They too consume the lotus fruit, but not as much as their neighbors. Their land stretches to a large river known as the Triton, which flows into the vast Tritonian lake. Within this lake lies an island called Phla. It is believed that the Lacedaemonians were instructed by an oracle to establish a settlement on this island. 
179. The following tale is often shared: It is said that when Jason built the Argo at the base of Mount Pelion, he loaded it with a hecatomb and a bronze tripod, intending to sail around the Peloponnese to reach Delphi. However, while passing Malea, a strong north wind blew him off course and carried him to Libya, where he found himself in the shallow waters of the Tritonian lake. Unable to find a way out, Jason was approached by Triton, who promised to show him the way out and ensure his safe passage if he handed over the tripod. Jason agreed, and Triton guided them out of the shallows, placing the tripod in his temple. Before doing so, Triton prophesied that if any descendant of the Argo's crew were to take the tripod, a hundred Greek cities would be established along the shores of the Tritonian lake. Upon hearing this, the local Libyan people decided to hide the tripod to prevent this from happening. 
180. Next to the Machlyes live the Auseans, separated by the Triton river and both residing along the shores of the Tritonian lake. The Machlyes have long hair at the back, while the Auseans have it in the front. They hold an annual festival for Athena, during which their young women are divided into two groups and engage in a battle using stones and sticks. They believe this honors their ancestral goddess, whom we know as Athena. Those who die from their injuries are labeled as false virgins. Before the battle, the entire community selects the most beautiful girl, dresses her in a Corinthian helmet and Greek armor, and parades her on a chariot along the lake shore. It is unclear what kind of armor they used before the Greeks arrived, but it is likely that it was Egyptian, as the Greeks are thought to have adopted their shield and helmet designs from Egypt. They claim that Athena was the daughter of Poseidon and the Tritonian lake, and due to a disagreement with her father, she chose to join Zeus, who then accepted her as his own daughter. In their society, relationships between men and women are casual, resembling the mating habits of animals. When a woman's child is old enough, the men gather within three months to determine which man the child most resembles, and that man is considered the father. 
181. I have now covered all the nomadic Libyans living along the coast. Further inland lies a region inhabited by wild animals, and beyond that, a long stretch of sandy ridge that extends from Thebes in Egypt to the Pillars of Heracles. Every ten days' journey along this ridge, there are large hills made of salt, with a cold, sweet water spring emerging from the center of each hill. People live around these springs, farthest from the wild animal territory and deeper into the desert. The first group of people encountered on this journey from Thebes, ten days away, are the Ammonians, who worship the Theban version of Zeus, which, as I mentioned earlier, has the head of a ram. They also have another spring, which has unique temperature changes throughout the day. It is warm at dawn, cooler during the market hours, and coldest at noon, which is when they water their gardens. As the day progresses, the water gradually warms up, becoming hot by sunset. It continues to heat up until midnight, when it reaches boiling point and bubbles. After midnight, the water cools down again until dawn. This spring is known as the Spring of the Sun. 
182. Ten days' journey away from the Ammonians, along the sandy ridge, there is another salt hill similar to the one near the Ammonians, with springs of water where people reside. This place is called Augila, and it is where the Nasamones travel to collect palm fruit. 
183. Ten days' journey from Augila, there is another salt hill with water springs and many fruit-bearing palms, just like the previous places. People called Garamantes live there, a large nation that plants crops on the salt-covered earth. The quickest route to the Lotus Eaters' land is from here, a thirty-day journey. Among the Garamantes, there are cattle that graze by walking backward because their horns curve forward, making it difficult for them to move forward without getting stuck in the ground. Apart from this, they are similar to other cattle, but their skin is thicker and tougher. The Garamantes ride four-horse chariots to chase the cave-dwelling Ethiopians, who are known to be the fastest runners among all the people we have heard of. These Ethiopians survive on snakes, lizards, and other such creatures. Their language is unique and unlike any other, sounding similar to the squeaking of bats. 
184. Ten days' journey from the Garamantes, there is another salt hill with water, inhabited by people called Atarantes. They are unique because they don't have individual names; the entire population is called Atarantes. When the sun is at its peak, they curse and insult it due to the scorching heat that affects their people and land. After another ten days' journey, there is yet another salt hill with water and people living there. Near this salt hill, there is a slender, cone-shaped mountain called Atlas. It is said to be so tall that its peak is always hidden by clouds, both in winter and summer. The locals refer to it as the pillar of heaven. The people living there, called Atlantes, derive their name from this mountain. It is believed that they do not eat any living creatures and do not experience dreams while sleeping. 
185. I am familiar with and can name all the peoples living along the ridge up to the Atlantes, but not beyond that point. However, I do know that the ridge extends as far as the Pillars of Heracles and even further. Every ten days' journey along the ridge, there is a salt mine, and people live there. Their houses are built using blocks of salt, as these areas of Libya do not experience rainfall. If it rained, the salt walls would not hold up. The salt found there is both white and purple. Beyond this ridge, the southern and inland parts of Libya are barren and without water. There are no wild animals, no rain, and no forests; this region is completely devoid of moisture. 
186. From Egypt to the Tritonian lake, the Libyans are nomads who consume meat and drink milk. They avoid eating cow meat for the same reasons as the Egyptians. They also do not raise pigs. The women of Cyrene consider it improper to eat cow meat due to their reverence for the Egyptian goddess Isis. They honor her with fasting and celebrations. Similarly, the women of Barca abstain from eating both pigs and cows. 
187. In the region west of the Tritonian lake, the Libyans are not nomads and have different customs, including how they treat their children compared to the nomadic Libyans. Many Libyan nomads, although not all, follow a practice where they burn the veins on their children's scalps or temples with sheep's wool grease when the children are four years old. They believe this prevents future health issues caused by phlegm draining from the head. As a result, the Libyans are considered the healthiest among all the people we know. It is uncertain if this practice is the sole reason for their good health, but they are indeed healthy. When the children experience pain from the burning, the Libyans use a remedy to soothe them by applying goat's urine. This information comes from the Libyans themselves. 
188. The nomads have a unique way of performing sacrifices. They cut a piece from the animal's ear as an offering and throw it over their house. Then, they twist the animal's neck to complete the sacrifice. They only worship the sun and moon as their gods, which is a common practice among their entire nation. However, those living near the Tritonian lake primarily worship Athena, followed by Triton and Poseidon. 
189. It seems that the Greek images of Athena, with their robe and aegis, were inspired by Libyan women's clothing. Although Libyan women wear leather and have hide thongs instead of snakes on their goatskin cloaks, the rest of their attire is quite similar. In fact, the name itself suggests that the clothing of Athena's statues came from Libya. Libyan women wear a hairless, tasseled garment called "aegea" over their dresses, dyed with madder. The Greeks have adapted the name "aegea" into their term "aegides." Additionally, it is believed that the ceremonial chant originated in Libya, as Libyan women are known for their melodious singing. The Greeks also learned to drive four-horse chariots from the Libyans. 
190. The nomads bury their dead in a similar way to the Greeks, except for the Nasamones. They bury their dead in a sitting position, making sure the dying person is sitting up when they pass away, instead of lying down. Their homes are made of asphodel stalks woven together with reeds, which allows them to be easily moved from one place to another. These are some of the unique customs of the Libyans. 
191. To the west of the Triton river, next to the Aseans, is the land of the Maxyes, a group of Libyans who farm and have houses. They wear their hair long on the right side of their heads, shave the left side, and paint their bodies with red pigment. They believe they are descendants of the people from Troy. Their land, along with the rest of the western part of Libya, has more wild animals and forests than the nomadic regions. The eastern part of Libya, inhabited by nomads, is flat and sandy up to the Triton river. However, the land to the west, where the farmers live, is very mountainous, wooded, and filled with wild animals. This area is home to huge snakes, lions, elephants, bears, and asps, as well as horned donkeys, dog-headed and headless people with eyes on their chests, and wild men and women, according to the Libyans. There are also many other creatures that are not just myths. 
192. In the nomads' land, there are no creatures like the ones mentioned earlier. However, there are other animals such as white-rumped antelopes, gazelles, hartebeest, donkeys (not the horned ones, but the ones called "undrinking" because they never drink), oryx with horns used for lyres, foxes, hyenas, porcupines, wild rams, dictys, jackals, panthers, borys, 60-inch long land crocodiles similar to lizards, ostriches, and small one-horned snakes. There are also other animals found in other places, except for deer and wild boar, which are not found in Libya at all. In this region, there are three types of mice: the two-footed, the "zegeries" (a Libyan word meaning "hills" in our language), and the bristly-haired ones. Weasels can also be found in the silphium, which are very similar to the weasels of Tartessus. These are the wild creatures found in the nomads' land, as far as we have been able to learn through our investigations. 
193. Next to the Maxyes in Libya, there are the Zauekes, a group whose women participate in battles by driving chariots. 
194. Next to the Zauekes are the Gyzantes, a group known for producing a lot of honey, both from bees and even more from skilled workers, according to some stories. It is well-known that they paint themselves with red pigment and eat apes, which are abundant in their mountainous region. 
195. Off the coast of the Carthaginians' land, there is an island called Cyrauis, which is 25 miles long and narrow. It's easy to reach from the mainland and is filled with olive trees and grapevines. People say that on this island, there's a lake where local girls collect gold dust from the mud using feathers covered in sticky pitch. I'm not sure if this is true, but I'm just writing what I've heard. Anything is possible, as I've seen pitch being collected from a pool in Zacynthus myself. There are many pools in Zacynthus, with the largest one being 70 feet long, wide, and 12 feet deep. People dip a pole with a myrtle branch attached to it into the pool and pull up pitch that smells like asphalt and is better than the pitch from Pieria. They then pour the pitch into a nearby pit, and when enough has gathered, they fill their containers from the pit. Any pitch that falls back into the pool gets carried underground and reappears in the sea, about half a mile away from the pool. So, the story about the island near the Libyan coast might be true as well. 
196. The Carthaginians tell another story about a place in Libya, located beyond the Pillars of Heracles. They say that when traders arrive there, they unload their goods and arrange them on the beach before going back to their ships and lighting a fire that produces smoke. The local people see the smoke and come to the shore, where they place gold as payment for the goods and then step away. The Carthaginians then leave their ships to check the gold. If they think the gold is a fair price for their goods, they take it and leave. If not, they return to their ships and wait. The locals then come back and add more gold until the traders are satisfied. It is said that both parties are honest in this exchange: the Carthaginians don't take the gold until it matches the value of their goods, and the locals don't touch the goods until the traders have taken the gold. 
197. In Libya, there are several groups of people, most of whom didn't care about the king of the Medes back when this story took place, and they still don't care about him now. As far as we know, there are four main nations living in this region. Two of them have been there since ancient times: the Libyans in the north and the Ethiopians in the south. The other two nations, the Phoenicians and the Greeks, arrived later and settled in the area. 
198. In my view, most of Libya doesn't have any outstanding features that would make it comparable to Asia or Europe, except for one area called Cinyps, named after its river. This region is as fertile as the most productive farmland in the world and is quite different from the rest of Libya. The soil is black and well-watered by springs, so it doesn't suffer from droughts or get damaged by heavy rain (which does happen in this part of Libya). The amount of grain it produces is similar to that of the land in Babylon. The land where the Euhesperitae people live is also good, producing up to a hundred times the amount of grain planted. However, the land in the Cinyps region is even more impressive, yielding three hundred times the amount of grain planted. 
199. The region of Cyrene, which is the highest part of Libya where nomads live, has an amazing benefit of having three harvest seasons. First, the crops along the coast become ripe and are harvested. Once those are collected, the crops in the middle region above the coast, known as the Hills, become ripe and are gathered. Finally, as soon as the middle region's crops are collected, the crops in the highest areas become ripe and ready for harvest. This means that when the last crops are being harvested, the earliest ones have already been used for food and drink. As a result, the people of Cyrene enjoy a harvest that lasts for eight months. That's all I have to say about this topic. 
200. When the Persians, sent by Aryandes from Egypt to help Pheretime, arrived at Barce, they began to attack the city. They demanded that the people who killed Arcesilaus be handed over, but the Barcaeans, who were all involved in the crime, refused to surrender. The Persians then besieged Barce for nine months, digging secret tunnels towards the walls and launching fierce attacks. A blacksmith discovered the hidden tunnels using a bronze shield. He walked around the inside of the walls, hitting the shield against the ground. In most places, the shield made a dull sound, but where there were tunnels, it produced a clear ringing sound. The Barcaeans then dug their own tunnels to intercept the Persians and killed those who were digging underground. In this way, the tunnels were found, and the people of the city were able to fend off the attacks. 
201. After a long time and many casualties on both sides, Amasis, the leader of the foot soldiers, came up with a plan. He knew that Barce couldn't be captured by force, but it could be taken through trickery. At night, he dug a wide trench and covered it with weak planks, which he then hid with a layer of dirt to make it look like the surrounding ground. When morning came, he invited the Barcaeans to discuss peace, and they agreed. They stood on the hidden trench and made a promise that their peace agreement would last as long as the ground beneath them remained unchanged. The Barcaeans agreed to pay the king a certain amount, and the Persians promised not to harm the Barcaeans. Once the agreement was made, the people of Barce trusted the Persians and opened their city gates, allowing their enemies to enter. However, the Persians then broke the hidden bridge and rushed into the city. They destroyed the bridge they had built so that they could keep their promise to the Barcaeans: the peace treaty would only last as long as the ground remained the same. By breaking the bridge, the treaty was no longer valid. 
202. When the Persians handed over the most guilty Barcaeans to Pheretime, she punished them severely. She impaled them and placed their bodies around the top of the wall. She also cut off the breasts of their women and displayed them around the wall in a similar way. Pheretime then told the Persians to take the remaining Barcaeans as their loot, except for those from Battus' family who were not involved in the murder. She gave control of the city to these innocent people. 
203. The Persians enslaved the remaining Barcaeans and headed home. When they arrived at the city of Cyrene, the people allowed them to pass through, fulfilling a certain prophecy. As they were passing through, Badres, the fleet admiral, wanted to capture the city, but Amasis, the land army general, disagreed, saying they were only sent to attack Barce, not any other Greek city. Eventually, they passed through Cyrene and set up camp on the hill of Lycaean Zeus. Later, they regretted not taking the city and tried to enter it again, but the Cyrenaeans refused to let them in. Suddenly, the Persians were overcome with fear, even though no one was attacking them. They fled to a place seven miles away and set up camp there. While they were there, a messenger from Aryandes arrived, asking them to return. The Persians requested and received food for their journey from the Cyrenaeans, and then they left for Egypt. However, they encountered Libyans who attacked the slower and weaker members of the army, killing them for their clothes and belongings. Despite these challenges, the Persians eventually made it back to Egypt. 
204. The Persian army went as far as Euhesperidae in Libya and didn't go any further. They took the captured Barcaeans from Egypt as slaves and brought them to the king. Darius then provided them with a town in Bactria to live in. The people named this town Barce, and it continued to be inhabited until my own time. 
205. However, Pheretime's life didn't have a happy ending either. After taking revenge on the Barcaeans and returning to Egypt, she faced a terrible death. While she was still alive, her body was infested with maggots. This shows that when people take extremely cruel revenge, they may face punishment from the gods. Pheretime, the daughter of Battus, took such a brutal revenge on the Barcaeans.
