1. When Alexander came back and shared what he learned from the Athenians, Mardonius eagerly led his army from Thessaly towards Athens. He also brought along all the people from the places he passed through. The leaders of Thessaly didn't regret their previous actions and were even more willing to help Mardonius. Thorax of Larissa, who had helped Xerxes escape earlier, now openly made a way for Mardonius to enter Hellas. 
2. When the army reached Boeotia during their march, the Thebans tried to convince Mardonius to stop there. They told him that their land was the perfect place to set up camp and that he could conquer all of Hellas without fighting. They explained that as long as the Greeks who were united stayed that way, it would be very hard for anyone to defeat them by force. However, the Thebans suggested that if Mardonius followed their advice, he could easily take control of their strategies. All he had to do was send money to the influential people in the Greek cities, which would cause division among them. With the help of his supporters, Mardonius could then easily conquer his enemies. 
3. The Thebans gave their advice, but Mardonius didn't listen. He really wanted to capture Athens again, partly because he was stubborn and partly because he planned to send a signal to the king at Sardis through a series of beacons across the islands, showing that he had taken Athens. When he arrived in Attica, he found the city empty, just like before. He learned that most of the people were on ships at Salamis. So, he captured the city, but none of its people. There was a ten-month gap between the king's capture of the city and Mardonius's later invasion. 
4. When Mardonius arrived in Athens, he sent a man named Murychides from Hellespont to Salamis with the same offer that Alexander the Macedonian had previously brought to the Athenians. He sent this offer again because, even though he knew the Athenians were against him, he thought they would give up their stubbornness now that their land was under his control and at his mercy. 
5. Murychides went to Salamis and presented Mardonius's message to the council. One of the council members, Lycidas, suggested that they should consider the offer and present it to the people. He said this either because he was bribed by Mardonius or because he liked the idea. However, the other Athenians in the council were very upset, as were those who heard about it later. They surrounded Lycidas and stoned him to death. They allowed Murychides, the man from Hellespont, to leave unharmed. There was a lot of commotion in Salamis because of what happened to Lycidas. When the Athenian women found out, they called on each other to join them, and they went to Lycidas's house and stoned his wife and children to death. 
6. The Athenians had moved to Salamis because they were waiting for the Peloponnesian army to help them while they were still in Attica. But when the Peloponnesians took too long to act and they heard that the invaders were already in Boeotia, they decided to move their belongings to a safer place and went to Salamis. They also sent representatives to Lacedaemon to complain that the Lacedaemonians had allowed the enemy to invade Attica and didn't help the Athenians fight them in Boeotia. The representatives reminded the Lacedaemonians about the promises the Persians had made to Athens if they switched sides, and warned them that the Athenians would find a way to save themselves if the Lacedaemonians didn't help them. 
7. At that time, the Lacedaemonians were celebrating the Hyacinthus festival and were focused on honoring the god. They were also building a wall on the Isthmus, which was almost finished. The Athenian envoys, along with representatives from Megara and Plataea, arrived in Lacedaemon and spoke to the ephors. They said, "The Athenians have a message: the king of the Medes is offering to return our land, make us his allies with equal rights and respect, and give us any additional land we choose. But we don't want to betray the Greek god Zeus or Hellas, so we haven't agreed. We've done this even though the Greeks have treated us unfairly and caused us harm. We know it would be more beneficial for us to make a deal with the Persians, but we won't do it willingly. We are being honest with the Greeks. However, you, who were once afraid that we would make a deal with the Persians, now know our true feelings and that we will never betray Hellas. You also know that the wall you're building on the Isthmus is almost done, yet you don't care about the Athenians and have abandoned us. You broke your promises to help us fight the Persians in Boeotia and allowed the enemy to invade Attica. The Athenians are angry with you for acting in a way that is not worthy of you. Now, we ask you to quickly send an army with us so we can face the invaders in Attica. Since we've lost Boeotia, the best place for a battle in our territory is the Thriasian plain." 
8. When the ephors heard the message, they didn't respond right away. Instead, they delayed their answer for ten days, putting it off day by day. During this time, all the Peloponnesians were working hard to fortify the Isthmus, and they were almost done. It's unclear why the Lacedaemonians insisted that the Athenians shouldn't join the Persians when Alexander the Macedonian came to Athens, but now they didn't seem to care. It might be because they felt secure with the fortified Isthmus and didn't think they needed the Athenians anymore. When Alexander came to Attica, their wall wasn't finished yet, and they were afraid of the Persians. 
9. The response to the Athenian delegation went like this: on the day before their final meeting, Chileus, a man from Tegea who had great influence with the Lacedaemonians, learned from the ephors what the Athenians had said. After hearing this, he reportedly told the ephors, "If the Athenians are our enemies and the Persians are our allies, then even if you build a strong wall across the Isthmus, the Persian will still have an easy way into the Peloponnese. So, listen to what the Athenians are saying before they make a decision that could bring disaster to Hellas." 
10. Chileus gave this advice to the ephors, who quickly took it seriously. Without telling the envoys from the cities, they ordered 5,000 Spartans to march before dawn. Each Spartan was assigned seven helots to assist them, and they put Pausanias, son of Cleombrotus, in charge. The leadership should have gone to Pleistarchus, son of Leonidas, but he was too young, so his guardian and cousin Pausanias took over. Pausanias' father, Cleombrotus, had already passed away. After leading the army that built the wall away from the Isthmus, he didn't live much longer. Cleombrotus had left the Isthmus because, while he was offering a sacrifice for victory over the Persians, the sun became dark in the sky. Pausanias chose Euryanax, son of Dorieus, from the same family, as his partner. 
11. Pausanias' army had already left Sparta, but the envoys, unaware of the expedition, came to the ephors as the day began, intending to return to their own cities. They said, "You Lacedaemonians stay here, celebrating your Hyacinthia festival while leaving your allies abandoned. Because of your actions and lack of support, the Athenians will make peace with the Persians as best they can. As allies of the king, we will march with him against any land his men lead us to. Then you will see the consequences of this for you." In response, the ephors swore that they believed their army was already at Orestheum, marching against the "strangers" (as they called the barbarians). The envoys, surprised by this, asked for more information and learned the whole truth. Amazed, they quickly followed the army. Along with them went 5,000 Lacedaemonian soldiers. 
12. They hurried to reach the Isthmus. However, the Argives had already promised Mardonius that they would stop the Spartans from going to war. When they found out that Pausanias and his army had left Sparta, they quickly sent their fastest long-distance runner to Attica as a messenger. When he arrived in Athens, he told Mardonius, "The Argives sent me to inform you that the young men from Lacedaemon have left for war, and the Argives can't stop them. So, make your plans accordingly." 
13. The messenger spoke and then left. When Mardonius heard the news, he didn't want to stay in Attica any longer. Before receiving this information, he had stayed in the area, wanting to know the Athenians' plans and what they would do. He didn't harm or attack Attica, as he still believed they would make a deal with him. But when he couldn't convince them and learned the truth, he left before Pausanias' army could enter the Isthmus. Before leaving, he burned Athens and destroyed any remaining walls, houses, or temples. Mardonius decided to leave because Attica wasn't suitable for horses, and if he lost a battle, there was only one narrow escape route that could be easily blocked by a few men. So, he planned to retreat to Thebes and fight there, where he had a friendly city behind him and the terrain was better for horsemen. 
14. Mardonius began to move his troops, and while on the road, he received a message that, in addition to the others, a thousand Lacedaemonians had arrived at Megara as an advance guard. Hearing this, he thought about how he could deal with them first. So, he turned his army towards Megara, with his cavalry leading the way and invading the city's lands. This was the farthest point in Europe that the Persian army reached. 
15. Soon, Mardonius received news that the Greeks had gathered at the Isthmus. So, he marched back through Decelea. The leaders of Boeotia asked the nearby Asopus residents for guidance, and they led Mardonius to Sphendalae and then to Tanagra. He camped there for the night, and the next day, he moved to Scolus, which was in Theban territory. Even though the Thebans supported the Persians, Mardonius destroyed their lands. He did this not out of hatred, but because he needed to create a stronghold for his army and have a safe place to retreat if the battle didn't go as planned. His army was positioned along the Asopus river, stretching from Erythrae, past Hysiae, and up to the lands of Plataea. However, the fortified camp he built wasn't that large; each side was about ten furlongs long. 
16. While the barbarians were busy, a Theban named Attaginus, son of Phrynon, prepared a grand feast and invited Mardonius and fifty prominent Persians. They accepted the invitation, and the dinner took place in Thebes. Thersander of Orchomenus, a highly respected man, shared the following story. He said that he was also invited to the dinner, along with fifty Thebans. Attaginus arranged the seating so that a Persian and a Theban shared each couch. As they drank together after dinner, the Persian sitting with Thersander asked him where he was from. Thersander replied that he was from Orchomenus. The Persian then said, "Since we have shared a meal and drinks, I want to share my thoughts with you, so you can make the right decisions for your safety. You see these Persians at the banquet and the army we left by the river? Soon, only a small number of them will be alive." The Persian then started crying. Surprised by his words, Thersander asked if he should tell Mardonius and the other important Persians about this. The Persian replied, "No one can change what a god has planned, and sometimes even the truth isn't believed. Many of us Persians know this, but we are bound by necessity. It's terrible to have knowledge but no power to change things." Thersander said he heard this story from Orchomenus and shared it with others before the battle of Plataea. 
17. Mardonius set up his camp in Boeotia. All the Greeks in the area who supported the Persians provided soldiers, and they joined Mardonius in attacking Athens, except for the Phocians. They sided with the Persians more out of necessity than willingness. A few days after the Persians arrived in Thebes, a thousand Phocian soldiers led by Harmocydes, a prominent figure, also arrived.  When the Phocians were in Thebes, Mardonius sent horsemen to order them to stand separately on the plain. After they did so, the entire Persian cavalry appeared, and rumors spread throughout the Greek army and among the Phocians that Mardonius planned to kill them with javelins. Hearing this, their leader Harmocydes encouraged them, saying, "Men of Phocis, since death seems inevitable at the hands of these people (likely due to the Thessalians' accusations), it's time for each of you to be brave. It's better to die fighting than to suffer a shameful death. Let's show them that the men they plan to kill are true Greeks." With these words, he motivated them. 
18. As the horsemen surrounded the Phocians, they charged at them, pretending to attack and even drawing their bows to shoot. It's possible that some actually did shoot. The Phocians resisted by gathering together and closing their ranks as much as they could. Seeing this, the horsemen turned around and rode away. It's unclear whether they intended to kill the Phocians at the Thessalians' request but changed their minds when they saw the Phocians ready to defend themselves, or if Mardonius simply wanted to test the Phocians' courage. After the horsemen left, Mardonius sent a messenger to the Phocians with this message: "Men of Phocis, be brave, for you have proven to be courageous and not as I was told. Now, continue this war with enthusiasm, for neither I nor the king will outdo you in providing service." That's how the situation with the Phocians turned out. 
19. When the Lacedaemonians arrived at the Isthmus, they set up camp there. The other Peloponnesians, who supported the better cause, saw the Spartans preparing for war and decided they shouldn't fall behind. So, they all marched from the Isthmus, with favorable omens from their sacrifices, and arrived at Eleusis. After offering more sacrifices and receiving positive omens, they continued their march, joined by the Athenians who had crossed over from Salamis. As they reached Erythrae in Boeotia, they heard that the barbarians were camped by the Asopus river. Knowing this, they positioned themselves opposite the enemy on the lower hills of Cithaeron. 
20. When the Greeks didn't move down to the plain, Mardonius sent his entire cavalry, led by Masistius (also known as Macistius), a highly respected Persian. He rode a Nesaean horse with a golden bit and elaborate decorations. The horsemen approached the Greeks and charged at them in groups. During the attack, they caused significant damage and taunted the Greeks by calling them women. 
21. It happened that the Megarians were positioned in the most vulnerable part of the battlefield, where the horsemen could easily attack. As they struggled to withstand the charges, the Megarians sent a messenger to the Greek generals, saying, "From the men of Megara to our allies: we can't hold off the Persian cavalry by ourselves any longer. We've been patient and brave, but we can't stay in this position. If you don't send reinforcements, we'll have to leave our post." Upon hearing this, Pausanias asked the Greeks if anyone would volunteer to help the Megarians. None of them wanted to, except for the Athenians. They sent 300 of their best soldiers, led by Olympiodorus, the son of Lampon, to take the Megarians' place and support them. 
22. The volunteers, along with the archers, positioned themselves at Erythrae in front of the entire Greek army. They fought for a long time, and the battle unfolded as follows: The cavalry charged in groups, with Masistius' horse leading the way. An arrow struck the horse in the side, causing it to rear up in pain and throw Masistius off. The Athenians immediately attacked him, capturing his horse and eventually killing him. At first, they couldn't harm him because he wore a purple tunic over a golden-scaled cuirass. However, someone noticed this and stabbed him in the eye, causing him to fall and die. By chance, the rest of the horsemen didn't see Masistius fall or die, so they retreated without realizing what had happened. When they stopped and noticed their leader was missing, they understood what had occurred. They then agreed to ride back together to recover his body. 
23. When the Athenians saw the horsemen charging at them all at once, instead of in groups like before, they called for help from the rest of the army. As the infantry rushed to their aid, a fierce battle erupted over the dead body. The 300 Athenians struggled and were close to giving up, but when the main army arrived, the tide turned, and the horsemen couldn't hold their ground or recover the body. They even lost more of their comrades in the process. Eventually, the horsemen retreated and stopped about two furlongs away to discuss their next move. With no one to lead them, they decided to report back to Mardonius. 
24. When the cavalry returned to their camp, Mardonius and the entire army were heartbroken over the loss of Masistius. They expressed their grief by cutting their own hair, as well as the hair of their horses and pack animals, and wailing loudly. The sound of their mourning echoed throughout Boeotia, as they had lost a man who was highly respected in Persia and by the king, second only to Mardonius. 
25. The barbarians honored Masistius' death in their traditional way, while the Greeks felt encouraged that they had withstood and repelled the attacking horsemen. They displayed the dead man's body on a cart and paraded it around, as it was impressive due to its size and grandeur. Many even left their positions to catch a glimpse of Masistius. Soon, the Greeks decided to move to Plataea, as the land there was more suitable for setting up camp than at Erythrae, mainly because it had better access to water. They aimed to settle near the Gargaphian spring in the area. So, they gathered their weapons and marched along the lower slopes of Cithaeron, passing Hysiae and reaching the lands of Plataea. Upon arrival, they organized themselves by nation near the Gargaphian spring and the shrine of the hero Androcrates, in a region with low hills and flat terrain. 
26. During the formation of the battle lines, a disagreement arose between the Tegeans and the Athenians, as both claimed the right to hold the second wing of the army. They justified their claims with stories of past and recent accomplishments. The Tegeans spoke first, explaining that they had always held this position in all united Peloponnesian campaigns, both ancient and recent, ever since the Heraclidae tried to return to the Peloponnese after Eurystheus' death. They earned this right due to a particular achievement they shared. When they joined the Achaeans and Ionians at the Isthmus for war and faced the returning exiles, Hyllus proposed that instead of risking both armies in battle, he would fight in single combat against the best champion chosen by the Peloponnesians. The Peloponnesians agreed, and they swore that if Hyllus won, the Heraclidae would return to their homeland, but if he lost, they would leave and not attempt to return for a hundred years. Echemus, the Tegean general and king, volunteered and was chosen from all the allies. He fought and killed Hyllus in the duel. As a result, the Peloponnesians granted the Tegeans the right to lead the second wing of the army in all united campaigns, along with other great privileges. The Tegeans acknowledged that they had no rivalry with the Lacedaemonians and allowed them to choose the command of whichever wing they wanted. However, they insisted that their place was at the head of the other wing, as it had always been. They argued that they were more deserving than the Athenians to hold that position, as they had fought many successful battles for the Lacedaemonians and others. They believed that their accomplishments, both past and recent, made them more qualified than the Athenians to hold the second wing. 
27. The Athenians responded to the Tegeans' words, saying that they believed they were gathered for battle, not for speeches. However, since the Tegeans had spoken about their past and recent accomplishments, the Athenians felt the need to prove why they deserved the place of honor more than the Arcadians. The Athenians reminded them that when the Heraclidae were rejected by every Greek people to escape the tyranny of the Mycenaeans, they alone welcomed them. Together, they defeated those who inhabited the Peloponnese and overcame Eurystheus' pride. They also mentioned their support for the Argives who had marched with Polynices against Thebes, and how they sent their army to recover and bury the dead in Eleusis. They recalled their victory against the Amazons who invaded Attica and their significant role in the Trojan War. However, the Athenians acknowledged that past accomplishments might not reflect the present, as people can change over time. They argued that even if they had no achievements to their name (though they had more than any other Greeks), they still deserved the honor because of their role at Marathon. They were the only Greeks who faced the Persians singlehandedly and defeated forty-six nations. They believed that this alone should grant them the right to hold the post. Despite this, the Athenians recognized that it was not the time for arguments about their position in the battle. They were willing to follow the Lacedaemonians' orders and take whatever place and face whatever enemy they deemed appropriate. They assured the Lacedaemonians that they would strive to be valiant men wherever they were placed and would obey their commands. 
28. The Athenians gave their response, and the entire army loudly agreed that they deserved the position more than the Arcadians. Thus, the Athenians were chosen over the Tegeans and secured their place. The entire Greek army was arranged as follows, including both the earlier and later arrivals. On the right wing, there were ten thousand Lacedaemonians. Half of them were Spartans, who had a guard of thirty-five thousand lightly armed helots, with seven assigned to each Spartan. The Spartans chose the Tegeans as their neighbors in battle to honor them and for their bravery; there were fifteen hundred Tegean soldiers. Next in line were five thousand Corinthians, who requested that the three hundred Potidaeans from Pallene join them. Following them were six hundred Arcadians from Orchomenus, three thousand Sicyonians, one thousand Troezenians, two hundred Lepreans, four hundred from Mycenae and Tiryns, one thousand Phliasians, and three hundred Hermionians. Next to the Hermionians were six hundred Eretrians and Styreans, four hundred Chalcidians, five hundred Ampraciots, eight hundred Leucadians and Anactorians, two hundred from Pale in Cephallenia, five hundred Aeginetans, three thousand Megarians, and six hundred Plataeans. At the end of the line, holding the left wing, were eight thousand Athenians led by their general, Aristides, son of Lysimachus. 
29. All of these soldiers, except for the seven assigned to each Spartan, were heavily armed, totaling thirty-eight thousand and seven hundred. This was the number of heavily armed soldiers prepared to fight against the barbarians. As for the lightly armed soldiers, there were seven for each Spartan in the army, amounting to thirty-five thousand, and all of them were equipped for war. The lightly armed soldiers from the rest of Lacedaemon and Hellas were equal in number to the heavily armed soldiers, totaling thirty-four thousand and five hundred. 
30. The total number of lightly armed soldiers who were fighters was sixty-nine thousand and five hundred. The entire Greek army gathered at Plataea, including both heavily armed and lightly armed soldiers, was one hundred and eight thousand and two hundred. There were also one thousand eight hundred Thespians present, who had survived previous battles. In total, there were one hundred and ten thousand soldiers, all of whom were positioned and camped by the Asopus river. 
31. When Mardonius' barbarian forces had finished mourning for Masistius and learned that the Greeks were at Plataea, they also arrived at the nearest part of the Asopus river. Mardonius arranged them for battle as follows: He positioned the Persians opposite the Lacedaemonians. Since the Persians greatly outnumbered the Lacedaemonians, they were arranged in deeper ranks, extending their line to face the Tegeans as well. Mardonius chose the strongest Persians to face the Lacedaemonians and placed the weaker ones against the Tegeans, based on advice from the Thebans. Next to the Persians, he placed the Medes opposite the soldiers from Corinth, Potidaea, Orchomenus, and Sicyon. Beside the Medes, he positioned the Bactrians against the men from Epidaurus, Troezen, Lepreum, Tiryns, Mycenae, and Phlius. After the Bactrians, he placed the Indians opposite the soldiers from Hermione, Eretria, Styra, and Chalcis. Next to the Indians, he positioned the Sacae against the Ampraciots, Anactorians, Leucadians, Paleans, and Aeginetans. Beside the Sacae, he placed the Boeotians, Locrians, Malians, Thessalians, and the thousand Phocians who supported the Greeks, opposite the Athenians, Plataeans, and Megarians. These Phocians had been besieged on Mount Parnassus and had been attacking Mardonius' army and his Greek allies. Mardonius also arranged the Macedonians and those from the Thessalian region to face the Athenians. 
32. The nations I mentioned were the most significant in Mardonius' army, but there were also various other groups, including Phrygians, Thracians, Mysians, Paeonians, and others, as well as Ethiopians and Egyptian swordsmen known as Hermotybies and Calasiries. These Egyptians were the only fighting men in Egypt and had been part of the naval forces until Mardonius disembarked them from their ships at Phalerum. They were not part of the land army that Xerxes led to Athens. As I have already mentioned, there were three hundred thousand barbarians in total. Regarding Mardonius' Greek allies, their exact number is unknown as they were not counted, but I estimate there were about fifty thousand of them. These were the infantry that was arranged for battle, while the cavalry was organized separately. 
33. Two days after both armies had been organized by their nations and battalions, they performed sacrifices. Tisamenus, a diviner, conducted the sacrifices for the Greeks. He was from Elis and belonged to the Iamid clan of the Clytiad family. The Lacedaemonians granted him citizenship in their city. This happened because when Tisamenus consulted the oracle at Delphi about having children, the priestess predicted that he would achieve five great victories. Misinterpreting the prophecy, he focused on physical training, believing he would win in athletic competitions. After preparing for the Five Contests, he almost won the Olympic prize in wrestling, losing only to Hieronymus of Andros. However, the Lacedaemonians realized that the oracle's message referred to victories in war, not sports. They tried to persuade Tisamenus to become a leader in their wars alongside their kings from the lineage of Heracles. Seeing the Spartans' eagerness, Tisamenus raised his demands, stating that he would only agree if they granted him full citizenship and all the rights of a citizen. At first, the Spartans were angry and abandoned their request. But when faced with the threat of the Persian army, they agreed to his terms. Tisamenus then added that he would not be satisfied with just his own citizenship; his brother Hegias must also be granted the same rights as a Spartan citizen. 
34. In making these demands, Tisamenus was similar to Melampus, although the comparison is between demands for citizenship and kingship. When the women of Argos went mad, the Argives asked Melampus to come from Pylos and cure them. In return, Melampus demanded half of their kingship as payment. The Argives refused and left. However, as the madness among their women worsened, they agreed to Melampus' demand and were ready to give him what he asked for. Seeing their change of heart, Melampus demanded even more, stating that he would only help if they also gave a third of their kingship to his brother Bias. Desperate, the Argives agreed to this as well. 
35. The Spartans were so eager to have Tisamenus on their side that they agreed to all his demands. Once they granted him and his brother citizenship, Tisamenus, now a Spartan, performed divination for them and helped them achieve five significant victories. Tisamenus and his brother were the only people who ever became citizens of Sparta from outside. The five victories were as follows: the first was at Plataea; the second was at Tegea against the Tegeans and Argives; the third was at Dipaea against all Arcadians except the Mantineans; the fourth was at Ithome against the Messenians; and the last victory was at Tanagra against the Athenians and Argives. These were the five victories that Tisamenus helped the Spartans win. 
36. Tisamenus, who was brought by the Spartans, served as the diviner for the Greeks at Plataea. The sacrifices he performed indicated that the Greeks would have good fortune if they focused on defending themselves. However, if they crossed the Asopus river and initiated the attack, they would face unfavorable outcomes. 
37. Mardonius' sacrifices also predicted a negative outcome if he attacked first, but a positive one if he only defended himself. He followed the Greek method of sacrifice, with Hegesistratus of Elis as his diviner. Hegesistratus was the most famous son of Tellias and had been imprisoned and sentenced to death by the Spartans for causing them significant harm. Facing a dangerous situation and expecting severe punishment before his death, Hegesistratus did something almost unbelievable. While locked in iron-bound stocks, he managed to get an iron weapon and bravely decided to cut off his own foot at the instep to escape. After doing so, he dug through the wall, avoiding the guards, and fled to Tegea. He traveled at night and hid during the day. On the third night, he reached Tegea, while the people of Lacedaemon searched for him. They were amazed to find the severed half of his foot but couldn't locate Hegesistratus himself. He had escaped to Tegea, a city that was hostile to Lacedaemon at the time. After recovering and making a wooden foot, Hegesistratus openly declared himself an enemy of the Lacedaemonians. However, his hatred for them didn't benefit him in the end, as they eventually found him performing divinations in Zacynthus and killed him. 
38. Hegesistratus' death, however, occurred after the events at Plataea. At that time, he was near the Asopus river, hired by Mardonius for a significant fee. He performed sacrifices and worked diligently, driven by his hatred for the Lacedaemonians and the desire for profit. Neither the Persians nor the Greeks with them could obtain favorable omens for battle, despite having their own diviner, Hippomachus of Leucas. As more Greeks continued to join the army, Timagenides, son of Herpys and a Theban, advised Mardonius to guard the exit of the pass over Cithaeron. He explained that this would cut off many Greeks who were arriving daily. 
39. The armies had been hiding opposite each other for eight days when Timagenides gave his advice. Mardonius realized it was a good suggestion, and that night, he sent his cavalry to guard the exit of the pass over Cithaeron, which leads towards Plataea. This pass is called the Three Heads by the Boeotians and the Oak's Heads by the Athenians. The horsemen's mission was not in vain, as they captured five hundred supply animals and the men accompanying them, who were bringing provisions from the Peloponnese for the Greek army. The Persians showed no mercy, killing both the men and the animals without hesitation. Once they had finished the slaughter, they rounded up the remaining captives and drove them to Mardonius' camp. 
40. Following this event, both sides waited for two more days, with neither side eager to initiate the battle. Although the barbarians approached the Asopus river to gauge the Greeks' intentions, neither army crossed it. However, Mardonius' cavalry continued to harass and disturb the Greeks. The Thebans, who were enthusiastic supporters of the Persians, actively participated in the war and guided the horsemen into battle. After that, it was the Persians and Medes who took charge, and they were determined to prove their bravery. 
41. After ten days of standoff, with no further action taken and the Greek army growing in size, Mardonius, son of Gobryas, and Artabazus, son of Pharnaces, held a debate. Artabazus, who was highly regarded by Xerxes, believed they should quickly move their camp and lead the entire army within Thebes' walls. There, they would have ample food and supplies for their animals. He suggested they could use their vast wealth in gold and silver to bribe influential individuals in Greek cities, leading to the Greeks surrendering their freedom without the need for battle. This opinion aligned with the Thebans, who also had special foresight. However, Mardonius' advice was more aggressive and impulsive, showing no signs of moderation. He believed their army was much stronger than the Greeks and that they should engage in battle immediately, before more Greek forces could gather. He suggested they should ignore Hegesistratus' sacrifices and not rely on them for favorable outcomes, but instead fight according to Persian customs. 
42. No one opposed Mardonius' argument, and his opinion prevailed since he was the appointed commander of the army. He then called the battalion leaders and the generals of the Greek allies to ask if they knew of any prophecy that predicted the Persians' defeat in Greece. Those who were summoned either didn't know the prophecies or were afraid to speak up. Mardonius then revealed that he was aware of an oracle that foretold the Persians would come to Greece and perish there after plundering the temple at Delphi. He assured them that they would not approach or attempt to plunder the temple, so no destruction would befall them. He encouraged those who wished the Persians well to rejoice, as they would defeat the Greeks. After speaking, Mardonius ordered everyone to prepare for the battle that would take place early the next morning. 
43. Mardonius claimed that a prophecy was about the Persians, but I know it was actually about the Illyrians and the Enchelees' army. However, there is a prophecy by Bacis related to this battle: "By Thermodon's stream and the grassy banks of Asopus, A gathering of Greeks will face the barbarian's war cry. Many a Median archer will fall, their untimely death upon them, In the battle when their day of doom arrives." I know that these verses and others similar to them from Musaeus referred to the Persians. The Thermodon river flows between Tanagra and Glisas. 
44. After discussing the oracles and Mardonius' encouragement, night fell, and both armies set up their guards. Late into the night, when it seemed that everyone was asleep and the camps were quiet, Alexander, son of Amyntas, the general and king of the Macedonians, approached the Athenian guards and requested to speak with their generals. Most of the guards stayed in their positions, while some went to inform their generals that a horseman from the Persian camp had arrived, wanting to speak with them and calling them by their names. 
45. Upon hearing the news, the generals quickly went to the outposts. When they arrived, Alexander told them, "Men of Athens, I share this message with you in confidence. Please only reveal it to Pausanias, or else my life will be in danger. I care deeply for all of Greece, and as a Greek descendant, I don't want to see our freedom replaced with slavery. I must inform you that Mardonius and his army have not received favorable omens from their sacrifices, which is why they haven't attacked yet. However, Mardonius plans to ignore the sacrifices and attack at dawn, fearing your numbers will grow. I urge you to be prepared. If Mardonius delays his attack, be patient and wait, as they have limited supplies. If this war ends in your favor, please remember to help me escape slavery, as I've risked my life to inform you of Mardonius' plans and prevent a surprise attack. I am Alexander the Macedonian." After sharing his message, Alexander rode back to his camp. 
46. The Athenian generals went to the right wing and informed Pausanias about their conversation with Alexander. Pausanias, worried about the Persians, suggested, "Since the battle will start at dawn, it's best for you Athenians to face the Persians, while we face the Boeotians and Greeks opposite you. You have experience fighting the Persians from the Battle of Marathon, while we don't. We Spartans have experience with Boeotians and Thessalians, but not with the Persians. Let's switch positions, with you on this wing and us on the left." The Athenians replied, "We were thinking the same thing when we saw the Persians opposite you but didn't want to upset you by suggesting it. Since you've brought it up, we're happy to agree and will do as you say." 
47. As both sides agreed, they switched positions at the first light of dawn. The Boeotians noticed this and informed Mardonius. Upon hearing this, Mardonius immediately tried to adjust by moving the Persians to face the Lacedaemonians. Pausanias realized what was happening, saw that his plan had been discovered, and led the Spartans back to the right wing. Mardonius did the same with his army's left wing. 
48. When everyone returned to their original positions, Mardonius sent a messenger to the Lacedaemonians with a message: "People say that you Lacedaemonians are very brave. They claim that you never run from a battle or leave your post, but instead, you either defeat your enemies or die trying. However, it seems that this isn't true. Before we could even attack, we saw you moving away from your position, letting the Athenians face us first, and positioning yourselves against those who are just our slaves. This doesn't seem like the actions of brave warriors. We were wrong about you. We thought you would challenge us, the Persians, to fight you. We were ready for that, but you didn't make such an offer and instead seemed afraid of us. So, let us challenge you instead. Why don't we have an equal number of fighters on both sides, with you representing the Greeks and us representing the barbarians? If the others want to fight too, they can do so after us. But if it's decided that we alone are enough, then let's fight it out. The winner of this contest will determine the victory for the entire army." 
49. The herald made this announcement, but when no one responded, he returned and reported what had happened. Mardonius was thrilled and proud of this apparent victory, so he sent his cavalry to attack the Greeks. The horsemen charged, shooting arrows and javelins at the entire Greek army, causing significant damage. These mounted archers were hard to fight against. They also ruined and blocked the Gargaphian spring, which was the main water source for the Greek army. Although only the Lacedaemonians were stationed near the spring and it was far from the other Greeks' positions, they still went there for water. They couldn't access the nearby Asopus river due to the horsemen and their arrows. 
50. When this occurred, the Greek generals, noticing that their army was cut off from water and disrupted by the horsemen, went to Pausanias on the right wing to discuss this and other issues. They had more problems than just the ones mentioned. They had run out of food, and the people they had sent to the Peloponnese to bring supplies were blocked by the horsemen and couldn't reach the army. 
51. The Greek generals decided in their meeting that if the Persians didn't attack that day, they would move to the Island. This place, about 10 furlongs away from the Asopus river and the Gargaphian spring, was near the town of Plataea. It was called the Island because a river split into two channels, creating a dry land area in between, before merging again. The river was named Oeroe, believed to be the daughter of Asopus according to local people. The plan was to move to this location to have access to water and avoid harm from the horsemen. They decided to change their position during the second watch of the night, so the Persians wouldn't see them leaving and the horsemen wouldn't chase and disrupt them. Additionally, once they reached the place surrounded by the divided channels of the Oeroe river, they planned to send half of their army to Cithaeron during the night. This was to rescue their followers who had gone to get provisions but were now trapped on Cithaeron. 
52. After making this plan, they endured a difficult day as the cavalry constantly attacked them. However, when the day ended and the horsemen stopped their assault, they began to leave at the agreed-upon time during the night. Instead of going to the planned location, they happily evaded the horsemen and fled to the town of Plataea. During their escape, they reached the temple of Hera, located outside the town and 20 furlongs away from the Gargaphian spring. They placed their weapons in front of the temple. 
53. They set up camp around the temple of Hera. Pausanias, noticing their departure, ordered the Lacedaemonians to pick up their weapons and follow the others, thinking they were heading to the agreed-upon location. While the other captains were ready to obey Pausanias, Amompharetus, son of Poliades and leader of the Pitanate battalion, refused to flee from the barbarians or bring shame to Sparta without being forced. He found the whole situation strange since he hadn't attended the recent council meeting. Pausanias and Euryanax were upset by Amompharetus' disobedience. However, they were even more concerned that his refusal would force them to leave the Pitanate battalion behind. They worried that if they followed the agreement with the other Greeks and abandoned him, Amompharetus and his men would be left to die. With this in mind, they kept the Laconian army in place and tried to convince Amompharetus that he was making a mistake. 
54. They tried to reason with Amompharetus, who was the only one left behind from the Lacedaemonians and Tegeans. Meanwhile, the Athenians stayed in their position, knowing that the Lacedaemonians' intentions and promises didn't always match. When the army began to move, the Athenians sent a horseman to check if the Spartans were planning to march or stay put, and to ask Pausanias what the Athenians should do. 
55. When the messenger reached the Lacedaemonians, he saw them still in their positions and their leaders engaged in a heated argument. Despite Euryanax and Pausanias trying to convince Amompharetus that the Lacedaemonians shouldn't risk staying there alone, they couldn't change his mind. As the Athenian messenger arrived, the dispute grew more intense. Amompharetus picked up a stone with both hands and threw it at Pausanias' feet, saying it was his vote against running away from the strangers (referring to the barbarians). Pausanias called him a madman. When the Athenian messenger asked the question he was sent with, Pausanias requested him to inform the Athenians about their current situation and asked them to join the Lacedaemonians. He also suggested that they should follow the Lacedaemonians' actions regarding departure. 
56. The messenger returned to the Athenians. As dawn arrived, the argument continued, and Pausanias, who had kept his army in place until then, finally gave the order to move between the hills, with the Tegeans following. He believed that Amompharetus wouldn't stay behind when the rest of the Lacedaemonians left, which turned out to be true. The Athenians organized themselves and began to march, but they took a different route than the Lacedaemonians. While the Lacedaemonians stayed close to the rough terrain and lower slopes of Cithaeron to avoid the Persian horsemen, the Athenians marched down into the plain. 
57. At first, Amompharetus believed that Pausanias wouldn't dare to leave him and his men behind, so he insisted on staying put. However, when Pausanias' men had already moved quite far, Amompharetus realized they had indeed left. He then ordered his battalion to pick up their weapons and follow the rest of the column. After covering a distance of ten furlongs, they found the rest of the troops waiting for them near the Molois stream and a place called Argiopium, where the shrine of Eleusinian Demeter is located. They waited there so they could help Amompharetus and his battalion if they didn't leave their post. As soon as Amompharetus' men arrived, the barbarians' cavalry attacked the army. The horsemen followed their usual tactics: when they saw no enemies in the area where the Greeks had been previously, they kept moving forward and attacked the Greeks as soon as they caught up with them. 
58. When Mardonius found out that the Greeks had left during the night and saw the empty area, he called Thorax of Larissa and his brothers Eurypylus and Thrasydeius and said, "What do you think now, sons of Aleuas, when you see this empty place? You, who live near them, always told me that the Lacedaemonians never ran from a battle and were experts in warfare. However, you just saw them change their position, and now we all see that they fled during the night. When they had to face the bravest warriors on earth, they clearly showed that they are not special, and neither are the other Greeks. You didn't know the Persians well, so I can understand why you praised these people who were somewhat familiar to you. But I'm more surprised that Artabazus, even if he was scared, gave us a cowardly suggestion to leave our camp and go to Thebes to be trapped. I'll definitely tell the king about this advice, but we'll discuss it later. Right now, we can't let our enemies do what they want; we must chase them until we catch them and make them pay for all the damage they've done to the Persians." 
59. With that, Mardonius quickly led the Persians across the Asopus River, chasing the Greeks, thinking they were fleeing. He was only targeting the Lacedaemonian and Tegean army, as the Athenians had taken a different route through rough terrain and were not visible to him. When the other barbarian battalions saw the Persians pursuing the Greeks, they immediately raised their standards and joined the chase, each moving as fast as possible, without any order in their ranks or assigned positions in the line. 
60. The barbarians rushed and shouted, thinking they would completely defeat the Greeks. However, when the cavalry attacked Pausanias, he sent a messenger to the Athenians with this message: "Athenians, in this important battle that will decide freedom or slavery for Greece, our allies have betrayed us by fleeing during the night. So, I've decided that we must protect each other by fighting as best as we can. If the cavalry had attacked you first, it would have been our duty, along with the loyal Tegeans, to help you. But now, since the main attack is on us, it's right for you to help the division that is under the most pressure. If you can't help us for some reason, please send us your archers. We trust that you'll support us, as you've been more committed than anyone else in this war." 
61. When the Athenians heard the message, they tried to help the Lacedaemonians and defend them with all their strength. However, as they began to move, they were attacked by the Greeks who had sided with the king. Because of this, they couldn't send any help at that time since they were busy fighting their closest enemies. So, the Lacedaemonians and Tegeans had to face the battle alone, with both their soldiers and lightly armed troops. There were 50,000 Lacedaemonians and 3,000 Tegeans, who had always been loyal to the Lacedaemonians. They offered sacrifices, hoping for a better outcome in the battle against Mardonius and his army. But they couldn't get any positive signs from their sacrifices, and many of them were killed or wounded in the meantime (since the Persians used their shields as a barrier and shot many arrows). As the Spartans were struggling and their sacrifices didn't help, Pausanias looked up to the temple of Hera in Plataea and prayed to the goddess, asking that they wouldn't be let down in their hopes. 
62. While Pausanias was still praying, the Tegean soldiers jumped forward and attacked the barbarians. Right after his prayer, the Lacedaemonians' sacrifices finally showed positive signs. They also charged at the Persians, who dropped their bows to face them. First, they fought near the shield barrier, and when that was down, a fierce and long battle took place around the temple of Demeter itself, until they engaged in close combat. The barbarians grabbed the spears and broke them. The Persians were not less brave or weaker, but they lacked armor and were not as skilled or experienced as their opponents. So, they would charge at the Spartans individually or in groups of various sizes, only to be defeated. 
63. Mardonius, riding a white horse and surrounded by a thousand elite Persian soldiers, fought fiercely against their enemies. As long as Mardonius was alive, the Persians held their ground and defended themselves, defeating many Lacedaemonians. However, when Mardonius was killed and his guards, who were the strongest part of the army, also fell, the rest of the Persians began to retreat before the Lacedaemonians. Their biggest disadvantage was that they had no armor over their clothes, making them essentially fight unprotected against fully armed opponents. 
64. On that day, the Spartans, as the oracle had predicted, took full revenge on Mardonius for the death of Leonidas. Pausanias, the son of Cleombrotus and grandson of Anaxandrides, achieved the most glorious victory known to us. (Pausanias' ancestors are the same as those of Leonidas, which I have mentioned earlier.) Mardonius was killed by Aeimnestus, a notable Spartan who later led three hundred men into battle at Stenyclerus against the entire army of Messenia. In that battle, Aeimnestus and his three hundred soldiers were killed. 
65. At Plataea, the Persians, defeated by the Lacedaemonians, fled in chaos back to their camp and inside the wooden walls they had built in Thebes' territory. It's quite amazing that even though the battle took place near Demeter's grove, there was no evidence of any Persian killed or entering the sacred area; most of them fell near the temple on non-sacred ground. In my opinion, if we must interpret the actions of the gods, the goddess herself must have denied them entry, as they had burned her temple, the shrine at Eleusis. 
66. In this battle, Artabazus, the son of Pharnaces, had always disagreed with the king's decision to leave Mardonius behind. His advice against fighting was ignored. Unhappy with Mardonius' actions, Artabazus did the following: He had a large army of about forty thousand men. He knew what the outcome of the battle would be, and as soon as the Greeks and Persians engaged, he instructed his troops to follow him wherever he led them, regardless of what they thought his intentions were. Pretending to lead them into battle, he continued forward. When he saw the Persians fleeing, he changed his approach and quickly retreated with his men, not towards the wooden fort or the walled city of Thebes, but to Phocis. His goal was to reach the Hellespont as fast as possible. 
67. So, Artabazus and his army went in that direction. Most of the Greeks who supported the king intentionally fought poorly, but the Boeotians were different; they fought against the Athenians for a long time. The Thebans on the Persian side were very passionate in the battle and didn't want to fight cowardly. As a result, the Athenians killed three hundred of their best fighters. Eventually, the Boeotians also gave in and fled to Thebes, but they didn't take the same route as the Persians and their allies, who hadn't fought to the end or achieved any significant accomplishments in battle. 
68. Their retreat, which happened before the battle ended and was caused by seeing the Persians flee, shows me that the fate of the barbarians depended on the Persians. So, everyone fled, except for the Boeotian and other cavalry. The cavalry helped the fleeing soldiers by staying between them and their enemies, protecting their friends from the Greeks during their escape. 
69. The Greeks, now having the advantage, chased and killed Xerxes' men. Meanwhile, a message reached the other Greeks near the temple of Hera, who hadn't joined the fight, informing them of the battle and Pausanias' victory. Upon hearing this, they set off without proper formation. Those with the Corinthians took the mountainous path towards the temple of Demeter, while those with the Megarians and Philasians chose the flatter route across the plain. However, as the Megarians and Philasians approached the enemy, the Theban horsemen, led by Asopodorus, son of Timander, noticed them coming hastily and disorganized. The horsemen attacked, trampling six hundred of them and chasing the rest towards Cithaeron. 
70. So, these people died without anyone noticing. When the Persians and the others retreated behind the wooden wall, they quickly climbed the towers and strengthened the wall as much as they could before the Lacedaemonians arrived. When the Athenians arrived, a fierce battle for the wall began. The barbarians were able to defend themselves and had an advantage over the Lacedaemonians, who weren't skilled in attacking walls. However, when the Athenians joined the fight, the battle for the wall became intense and lasted a long time. Eventually, the Athenians, through bravery and persistence, climbed the wall and broke through it. The Greeks rushed in through the opening they had created; the Tegeans were the first to enter and they plundered Mardonius' tent, taking his bronze horse feeding trough, which was a remarkable sight. They dedicated this feeding trough to the temple of Athena Alea. Everything else they took was added to the common pool, as did the rest of the Greeks. As for the barbarians, they didn't regroup once the wall was down, and no one thought of defending themselves because the terrified people in the small space and the large crowds were in great distress. The Greeks were able to kill so many that out of the two hundred and sixty thousand who remained after Artabazus fled with his forty thousand, only about three thousand survived. In the battle, ninety-one Lacedaemonians from Sparta, seventeen Tegeans, and fifty-two Athenians were killed. 
71. Among the barbarians, the best fighters were the Persian infantry and the Sacae cavalry, and it is said that Mardonius was the bravest of them all. Among the Greeks, the Tegeans and Athenians fought well, but the Lacedaemonians were the most courageous. My main evidence for this is that they fought against the strongest part of the enemy's army and defeated them. In my opinion, the bravest man was Aristodemus, who had been criticized and dishonored for being the only survivor of the three hundred at Thermopylae. Next in bravery were Posidonius, Philocyon, and Amompharetus. However, when there was a general discussion about who had fought the bravest, the Spartans present believed that Aristodemus, who clearly wanted to die due to the shame he carried, had achieved great deeds, but Posidonius, who didn't want to die, proved to be a more courageous fighter, making him the better man. They might have said this out of jealousy, but all the aforementioned who were killed in the battle were honored, except for Aristodemus. He didn't receive any honor because he desired death due to the shame he had previously experienced. 
72. These individuals were the most renowned of all who fought at Plataea. Callicrates, who was considered the finest among not only the Lacedaemonians but also all other Greeks, died away from the battle. While sitting in his place during Pausanias' sacrifice, Callicrates was wounded in the side by an arrow. As his comrades fought, he was carried out of the battle and died a slow death. Speaking to Arimnestus, a Plataean, he expressed that he wasn't sad about dying for Greece; instead, he was disappointed that he hadn't been able to strike a blow or achieve any deed worthy of his abilities, despite his strong desire to do so. 
73. Sophanes, son of Eutychides, is said to have gained fame among the Athenians. He was from the town of Decelea, whose people once performed a deed of great value, according to the Athenians themselves. In the past, when the sons of Tyndarus were trying to recover Helen, they invaded Attica with a large army and searched the towns, not knowing where Helen was hidden. It is said that the Deceleans, and some say Decelus himself, revealed the truth to the sons of Tyndarus due to their anger at Theseus' arrogance and concern for the entire land of Attica. They guided them to Aphidnae, which Titacus, one of the original inhabitants, handed over to the Tyndaridae. Because of this deed, the Deceleans have always enjoyed freedom from all dues and special privileges at feasts in Sparta. Even during the war between the Athenians and Peloponnesians, which took place many years later, the Lacedaemonians did not harm Decelea while they attacked the rest of Attica. 
74. Sophanes, from that town, was the best Athenian fighter in the battle, and there are two stories about him. The first story says that he carried an iron anchor attached to his armor's belt with a bronze chain. He would throw this anchor when attacking his enemies so that they couldn't move him from his position as they left their ranks. When they fled, he planned to pull up his anchor and chase them. That's how the first story goes. The second story, which contradicts the first, claims that he didn't wear an iron anchor attached to his armor. Instead, his shield, which he constantly spun around and never held still, had an anchor as a symbol on it. 
75. Sophanes also performed another remarkable act. During the Athenian siege of Aegina, he challenged and killed Eurybates, an Argive who had won the Five Contests. Much later, Sophanes met his end while serving as a general of the Athenians alongside Leagrus, son of Glaucon. He was killed by the Edonians at Datus in a battle over gold mines. 
76. Right after the Greeks defeated the barbarians at Plataea, a woman who was the concubine of Pharandates, a Persian and son of Teaspis, left the enemy and approached the Greeks. Hearing that the Persians had been defeated and the Greeks were victorious, she and her attendants adorned themselves with gold ornaments and beautiful clothes. Dressed like this, she left her carriage and approached the Lacedaemonians while they were still fighting. When she saw Pausanias, whose name and country she had often heard of, directing everything, she recognized him and pleaded with him, holding onto his knees: "Save me, O king of Sparta, from being a captive slave. You have already helped me by defeating those men who have no respect for the gods or any divine beings. I am from Cos, the daughter of Hegetorides, son of Antagoras. The Persian took me by force and held me captive." "Be brave, lady," Pausanias replied, "for you are under my protection, and if you are truly the daughter of Hegetorides of Cos, he is my closest friend among all who live in those lands." For the time being, he entrusted her to the ephors who were present. Later, he sent her to Aegina, where she wanted to go. 
77. Soon after the woman arrived, the men of Mantinea came when everything was already over. When they found out that they had missed the battle, they were very upset and said they should punish themselves for it. Hearing that the Medes with Artabazus were escaping, they wanted to chase them all the way to Thessaly. However, the Lacedaemonians didn't allow them to pursue the fleeing men. So, when they returned to their own land, the Mantineans banished their army leaders from the country. After the Mantineans, the men of Elis arrived, who also left feeling very upset. Upon their departure, they too banished their leaders. That's what happened with the Mantineans and Eleans. 
78. In the army of the Aeginetans at Plataea, there was a man named Lampon, son of Pytheas, who was a prominent figure in Aegina. He rushed to Pausanias with a rather outrageous suggestion. Approaching him, Lampon said, "Son of Cleombrotus, you have accomplished an incredible and glorious feat. The god has allowed you to save Hellas and become more famous than any other Greek we know. Now, you must complete the remaining task to make your fame even greater and prevent any barbarian from daring to attack the Greeks in the future. When Leonidas was killed at Thermopylae, Mardonius and Xerxes beheaded him and put his head on a pole. Do the same to them, and you will earn praise from all Spartans and the rest of Hellas. By impaling Mardonius, you will avenge your uncle Leonidas." 
79. Lampon said this, hoping to please Pausanias. However, Pausanias replied, "Aeginetan, I appreciate your goodwill and thoughtfulness, but your judgment is off. First, you praise me, my homeland, and my actions, but then you bring me down to nothing when you suggest I should disrespect the dead, claiming it will bring me more praise. Such an act is more fitting for barbarians than Greeks, and we even criticize barbarians for it. I would rather not be liked by the people of Aegina or anyone else who approves of such actions. I am content if I please the Spartans with righteous deeds and words. As for Leonidas, whom you want me to avenge, I believe he has received enough vengeance; the countless souls of those you see here have honored him and the others who died at Thermopylae. But let me warn you: do not come to me with such words again or give me such advice. Be grateful that you are not being punished now." 
80. After Lampon left, Pausanias announced that no one should touch the spoils and instructed the helots to gather everything together. The helots spread out across the camp and discovered tents decorated with gold and silver, gilded and silver-plated couches, golden bowls and cups, and other drinking vessels. They also found sacks on wagons containing gold and silver cauldrons. They took armlets, torques, and golden daggers from the dead bodies, while ignoring the embroidered clothing. The helots showed much of what they found, but they also stole and sold many items to the Aeginetans. As a result, the Aeginetans began building their great fortunes by buying gold from the helots as if it were bronze. 
81. After gathering all the loot, they set aside a tenth for the god of Delphi. From this, they made and dedicated a tripod with a bronze three-headed serpent, located near the altar. They also set aside another tenth for the god of Olympia, from which they made and dedicated a ten-cubit high bronze statue of Zeus. Another tenth was set aside for the god of the Isthmus, from which they created a seven-cubit high bronze Poseidon statue.  Once they had set these portions aside, they divided the remaining loot. Each person received Persian concubines, gold, silver, and other items, as well as beasts of burden, according to their worth. It is not mentioned how much was given to those who fought the best at Plataea, but it is likely that they also received gifts. Pausanias was given ten times more of everything, including women, horses, talents, camels, and other items. 
82. There is another story told. When Xerxes fled from Hellas, he left Mardonius with his own luxurious belongings. Pausanias, seeing Mardonius' possessions with their gold, silver, and colorful tapestries, asked the bakers and cooks to prepare a dinner like they used to for Mardonius. They followed his orders, and when Pausanias saw the lavish setup with gold and silver couches, tables, and the extravagant banquet, he was amazed. As a joke, he told his own servants to prepare a simple Laconian-style dinner. When the modest meal was ready, Pausanias laughed and called for the Greek generals. Once they gathered, he pointed out the differences between the two dinners and said, "Men of Hellas, I brought you here to show you the foolishness of the Medes' leader who, with such luxurious provisions as you see, came here to take away our humble possessions." It is said that Pausanias spoke these words to the Greek generals. 
83. Long after these events, many Plataeans discovered chests filled with gold, silver, and other items. Additionally, when they gathered the bodies in one place and removed the flesh, they found a skull made of a single piece of bone without any seams. They also found a jawbone where the upper teeth were a single, continuous bone, including both front teeth and molars. They even saw the body of a man who was five cubits tall. 
84. Regarding Mardonius' body, it was taken away the day after the battle, but I cannot say for sure who did it. I have heard that many countries claimed to have buried Mardonius, and I know that many were generously rewarded by Mardonius' son, Artontes, for this act. However, I cannot determine who actually stole and buried Mardonius' body. Some say it was Dionysophanes, an Ephesian. That's all I know about Mardonius' burial. 
85. After dividing the spoils at Plataea, the Greeks buried each group of their dead separately. The Lacedaemonians made three tombs; one for their "irens," including Posidonius, Amompharetus, Philocyon, and Callicrates. The second tomb was for the rest of the Spartans, and the third for the helots. That's how the Lacedaemonians buried their dead. The Tegeans, however, buried all their dead together in a separate place, and the Athenians did the same with their own dead. The Megarians and Phliasians also buried those who had been killed by the horsemen together. All these tombs were filled with dead bodies. As for the other states with tombs at Plataeae, their tombs were empty mounds built for future generations, as they were ashamed of not being present at the battle. There is one tomb called the tomb of the Aeginetans, which, as I found out, was built ten years later at the request of the Aeginetans by their patron and protector, Cleades, son of Autodicus, a Plataean. 
86. Once the Greeks had buried their dead at Plataea, they decided to march towards Thebes and demand the surrender of those who had sided with the Persians, especially Timagenidas and Attaginus, who were among their most prominent men. They threatened that if these men were not handed over, they would not leave until they had captured the city. With this intention, they arrived on the eleventh day after the battle and besieged Thebes, demanding the men's surrender. When the Thebans refused, the Greeks destroyed their lands and attacked the city walls. 
87. Realizing that the Greeks wouldn't stop their attacks and nineteen days had passed, Timagenidas spoke to the Thebans, saying, "Fellow Thebans, since the Greeks won't end the siege until they capture Thebes or we surrender, don't let Boeotia suffer more because of us. If they want money and our surrender is just an excuse, let's give them money from our shared treasury (since we all decided to side with the Persians, not just us). But if they're besieging the city just to get us, then we'll give ourselves up for trial." This seemed like a good and timely suggestion, so the Thebans quickly sent a messenger to Pausanias, offering to surrender the men. 
88. They agreed on these terms, but Attaginus managed to escape from the town. His sons were captured, but Pausanias believed they were innocent, saying they had no part in the betrayal. The other men who were surrendered by the Thebans thought they would face a trial and were confident they could avoid punishment through bribery. However, Pausanias suspected this and sent the entire allied army away. He then took the men to Corinth, where he executed them. This is what happened at Plataea and Thebes. 
89. Artabazus, the son of Pharnaces, was already far away from Plataea during his escape. When he arrived among the Thessalians, they welcomed him warmly and asked about the rest of the army, unaware of what had happened at Plataea. Artabazus realized that if he told them the whole truth about the battle, he would put his own life and the lives of those with him in danger, as they might attack him upon hearing the news. So, even though he hadn't told the Phocians anything, he said to the Thessalians, "I am quickly heading to Thrace with the men you see here, as I have been sent from the army for a specific purpose. Mardonius and his army should be following closely behind us. It's up to you to welcome him and show your support, as you won't regret it later." With that, he hurriedly led his army towards Thrace through Thessaly and Macedonia, taking the shortest inland route. Eventually, he reached Byzantium, but many of his soldiers were left behind, either killed by Thracians or overcome by hunger and exhaustion. From Byzantium, he crossed over in boats and returned to Asia. That's how Artabazus made his way back. 
90. On the same day the Persians were defeated at Plataea, they also faced a similar fate at Mykale in Ionia. When the Greeks, led by Leutychides the Lacedaemonian, were camped at Delos, some messengers from Samos arrived secretly, without the Persians or the tyrant Theomestor knowing. These messengers were Lampon, Athenagoras, and Hegesistratus. When they met with the Greek generals, Hegesistratus passionately spoke, "If the Ionians see you, they will rebel against the Persians, and the barbarians won't stay. If they do stay, you'll have a great victory. Please, in the name of our shared gods, free the Greeks from slavery and drive the barbarians away. It will be easy for you, as the Persian ships are no match for yours. If you think we might be deceiving you, we're willing to be taken as hostages on your ships." The messengers urged the Greeks to help them, assuring them of the Persians' weakness and offering themselves as hostages to prove their sincerity. 
91. While the Samian messenger was pleading passionately, Leutychides asked him (either seeking a sign or due to a fortunate divine intervention), "Samian stranger, what is your name?" "Hegesistratus," he replied. Leutychides then interrupted whatever else Hegesistratus was about to say and exclaimed, "I accept the good omen of your name, Samian stranger! Now, make sure that before you leave, you and your companions promise that the Samians will be our dedicated allies." 
92. Leutychides spoke and immediately took action. The Samians quickly pledged and swore an oath to be allies with the Greeks. After this, the others left, but Leutychides asked Hegesistratus to sail with the Greeks because his name was a good omen. The Greeks waited for a day, and on the next day, they sought and received a positive sign. Their diviner was Deiphonus, the son of Evenius, a man from Apollonia in the Ionian Gulf. Deiphonus' father, Evenius, had once experienced something I will now describe. 
93. In Apollonia, there was a special flock of sheep dedicated to the Sun. During the day, the sheep grazed beside the Chon River, which flowed from Mount Lacmon through Apollonia's lands and into the sea near Oricum's harbor. At night, the town's wealthiest and most prominent citizens took turns watching the flock for a year, as the people of Apollonia highly valued it based on an oracle's teachings. The flock was kept in a distant cave away from the town. During the time I'm talking about, Evenius was the chosen watchman. One night, he fell asleep, and wolves sneaked past him into the cave, killing about sixty sheep. Evenius kept quiet about the incident, planning to replace the lost sheep by buying new ones. However, the people of Apollonia eventually found out, put him on trial, and sentenced him to be blinded for falling asleep on duty. After they blinded Evenius, their flocks stopped reproducing, and their land no longer produced fruit as it used to. The people of Apollonia consulted the oracles at Dodona and Delphi to find out the cause of their misfortune. The gods, through their prophets, told them that they had acted unjustly by blinding Evenius, the guardian of the sacred flock. The gods explained that they had sent the wolves themselves and would continue to seek revenge until the people made amends with Evenius in a way that he chose and approved. Once that was done, the gods promised to give Evenius a gift that would make many people consider him fortunate. 
94. The people of Apollonia received this oracle and kept it a secret. They assigned some of their citizens to handle the matter, and they approached Evenius in the following way. They sat down with him and talked about various topics until they eventually began discussing his unfortunate situation. Steering the conversation in this direction, they asked him what kind of compensation he would want if the people of Apollonia promised to make up for what they had done to him. Unaware of the oracle, Evenius said he would like to have the lands of certain individuals whom he believed had the two most beautiful estates in Apollonia, as well as the most beautiful house in town. If he could have these, he would let go of his anger and be satisfied with the compensation. Hearing this, the people sitting with him replied, "Evenius, the people of Apollonia will give you what you asked for as restitution for the loss of your sight, following the oracle's instructions." Upon hearing this, Evenius became very angry, as he realized the whole story and felt that they had tricked him. However, they did buy the properties from their owners and gave them to Evenius. From that day on, he had a natural gift for divination, which brought him fame. 
95. Deiphonus, the son of Evenius, was hired by the Corinthians and served as the army's diviner. However, I have heard it mentioned that Deiphonus was not actually Evenius' son, but instead falsely used that name and earned money by working as a diviner throughout Greece. 
96. After receiving positive signs, the Greeks set sail from Delos towards Samos. As they approached Calamisa in Samian territory, they anchored near the temple of Hera and prepared for a sea battle. When the Persians learned of the Greeks' approach, they also set sail, heading for the mainland with all their ships except the Phoenicians, who were sent in a different direction. The Persians decided not to engage in a sea battle, as they believed they were outmatched. Instead, they aimed to join their army at Mykale, which had been left behind by Xerxes' orders to maintain control over Ionia. This army consisted of 60,000 men, led by Tigranes, the most distinguished and tallest man in Persia. The Persian admirals planned to seek refuge with this army, beach their ships, and build a protective fence around them to safeguard both the ships and themselves. 
97. With this plan in mind, the Persians set sail. As they passed the temple of the Goddesses at Mykale, they reached the Gaeson and Scolopois, where there was a temple dedicated to Eleusinian Demeter. This temple had been built by Philistus, son of Pasicles, when he accompanied Nileus, son of Codrus, to establish the city of Miletus. The Persians beached their ships at this location and built a fence around them using stones and the trunks of trees they cut down from nearby orchards. They also set up stakes around the fence, preparing themselves for either a siege or a victory, considering both possibilities. 
98. When the Greeks found out that the barbarians had retreated to the mainland, they were disappointed that their enemy had escaped and were unsure whether to return home or sail towards the Hellespont. Eventually, they decided to sail to the mainland instead. They prepared themselves with gangways and other necessary equipment for a sea battle and headed towards Mykale. Upon arriving, they saw the ships beached within the wall and a large army lined up along the shore. No one came out to meet them. Leutychides, in his ship, sailed as close to the shore as possible and had a herald announce the following message to the Ionians: "Men of Ionia, listen and understand what I say, as the Persians won't comprehend any of the instructions I give you during the battle. First, remember your freedom, and then use the battle cry 'Hebe.' Let those who hear this message pass it on to those who haven't heard it." This strategy was similar to Themistocles' approach at Artemisium. The message would either remain unknown to the barbarians and persuade the Ionians, or if it was reported to the barbarians, it would cause them to distrust their Greek allies. 
99. Following Leutychides' advice, the Greeks brought their ships to shore and disembarked on the beach, where they formed a battle line. The Persians, noticing the Greeks preparing for battle and encouraging the Ionians, decided to take away the Samians' armor, suspecting that they might help the Greeks. This suspicion arose because the Samians had previously freed some Athenian captives, who had been left behind in Attica and captured by Xerxes' army. The Samians had not only set them free but also provided them with supplies for their journey back to Athens. As a result, the Persians considered the Samians untrustworthy for having freed five hundred of Xerxes' enemies. Additionally, the Persians assigned the Milesians to guard the mountain passes leading to the heights of Mykale, claiming that they were most familiar with the area. However, the real reason for this decision was to keep the Milesians separate from the rest of their army. In this way, the Persians protected themselves from those Ionians who they believed might turn against them if given the chance. They then arranged their shields closely together to create a barricade. 
100. The Greeks, having prepared themselves, advanced their line towards the barbarians. As they moved forward, a rumor spread throughout the army, and a herald's wand was spotted lying near the water's edge. The rumor suggested that the Greeks had won a battle against Mardonius' army in Boeotia. This event showed clear signs of divine intervention, as the message, which greatly encouraged the army and made them ready to face danger, reached the Greeks on the very same day that the Persians faced defeat at Plataea and were about to experience another disaster at Mykale. 
101. Furthermore, there was an interesting coincidence that both battlefields had precincts dedicated to Eleusinian Demeter. As mentioned earlier, the fight at Plataea took place near Demeter's temple, and the same was true for the battle at Mykale. It turned out that the rumor of the Greeks' victory under Pausanias was accurate, as the defeat at Plataea occurred earlier in the day, while the defeat at Mykale happened in the afternoon. The Greeks later confirmed that both events took place on the same day of the same month. Before the rumor reached them, the Greeks had been anxious, worrying more about their fellow Greeks with Pausanias and the possibility of Hellas falling to Mardonius. However, when the news spread among them, they gained strength and speed in their attack. Both the Greeks and the barbarians were eager for battle, knowing that the islands and the Hellespont would be the rewards for victory. 
102. The Athenians and those closest to them, which made up about half of the line, advanced over the beach and flat ground. Meanwhile, the Lacedaemonians and those next to them had to navigate through a ravine and hills. While the Lacedaemonians were making their way around, the others on the opposite wing had already begun fighting. As long as the Persians' shields remained upright, they defended themselves and held their ground in the battle. However, when the Athenians and their neighbors in the line decided to fight more fiercely to win the victory before the Lacedaemonians could, the battle's tide changed. Breaking down the shields, they charged together into the midst of the Persians, who initially withstood the attack but eventually fled within their wall. The Athenians, Corinthians, Sicyonians, and Troezenians, who were next to each other in the line, pursued them closely and stormed in together. Once the walled area had been destroyed, the barbarians stopped defending themselves and fled, except for the Persians, who formed small groups and fought against any Greeks who entered the walls. Out of the Persian leaders, two escaped by fleeing, and two were killed. Artayntes and Ithanitres, the fleet admirals, managed to escape, while Mardontes and Tigranes, the land army generals, were killed in battle. 
103. While the Persians continued to fight, the Lacedaemonians and their allies arrived and completed the remaining task. The Greeks also lost many men in this battle, including the Sicyonians and their general, Perilaus. As for the Samians, who were part of the Median army and had been disarmed, they saw from the beginning that victory was uncertain and did their best to help the Greeks. When the other Ionians saw the Samians taking the lead, they too left the Persians and attacked the foreigners. 
104. For their own safety, the Persians had assigned the Milesians to watch the passes, so that if anything happened to the Persian army, like what eventually occurred, they would have guides to lead them safely to the heights of Mykale. The Milesians were given this task for the reasons mentioned earlier and to prevent them from being with the army and potentially turning against it. However, they acted completely opposite to their assigned duty; they led the fleeing Persians on paths that took them straight to their enemies, and eventually, the Milesians themselves became their worst enemies and killed them. This is how Ionia revolted against the Persians for the second time. 
105. In that battle, the Greeks who fought the best were the Athenians, and the top Athenian fighter was Hermolycus, son of Euthoenus, who was skilled in the pancratium. Later on, Hermolycus died in a battle at Cyrnus in Carystus during a war between the Athenians and Carystians, and his body lay at Geraestus. After the Athenians, the best fighters were from Corinth, Troezen, and Sicyon. 
106. When the Greeks had defeated most of the barbarians, either in battle or by forcing them to flee, they gathered their spoils on the beach and discovered some valuable resources. After burning the ships and the entire wall, they sailed away. Upon arriving at Samos, they discussed the possibility of relocating all Greeks from Ionia and determining the best Greek lands under their control to settle the Ionians, leaving the country to the barbarians. They believed it was impossible to protect the Ionians from their enemies forever. If they didn't, they had no hope that the Persians would let the Ionians go unpunished. The Peloponnesians in charge suggested relocating the people from the lands of those Greek nations that had sided with the Persians and giving their land to the Ionians. However, the Athenians strongly opposed the idea of removing the Greeks from Ionia or allowing the Peloponnesians to decide the fate of Athenian colonies. As a result, the Peloponnesians gave in to the Athenians' resistance. They then welcomed the Samians, Chians, Lesbians, and other islanders who had served with their forces into their alliance, making them pledge and swear oaths to remain loyal and not abandon their allies. After the oaths were taken, the Greeks set sail to break the bridges, assuming they were still intact. They headed towards the Hellespont. 
107. The few barbarians who escaped were driven to the heights of Mykale and made their way to Sardis. While they were traveling, Masistes, son of Darius, who happened to be present during the Persian disaster, harshly criticized the admiral Artayntes. He told him, among other things, that his leadership was worse than a woman's and that no punishment was too severe for the damage he had caused to the king's estate. In Persia, being called worse than a woman is considered the greatest insult. These insults angered Artayntes so much that he drew his sword to kill Masistes. However, Xenagoras, son of Praxilaus of Halicarnassus, who was standing behind Artayntes, saw him attack Masistes. He grabbed Artayntes around the waist, lifted him, and threw him to the ground. Meanwhile, Masistes' guards also intervened. By doing this, Xenagoras earned the gratitude of both Masistes and King Xerxes for saving the king's brother. As a reward for his actions, the king made Xenagoras the ruler of all Cilicia. After this incident, they continued their journey without any further issues and arrived in Sardis. 
108. It so happened that the king had been in Sardis ever since he fled from Athens after his defeat in the sea battle. While in Sardis, he fell in love with Masistes' wife, who was also there. Despite his efforts, he couldn't convince her to be with him, and he didn't want to force her out of respect for his brother Masistes. This also mattered to the woman, as she knew she wouldn't be forced against her will. To achieve his goal, Xerxes decided to arrange a marriage between his son Darius and the daughter of Masistes and his wife, thinking this would help him win her over. So, he formally arranged their engagement and then went to Susa. However, when he arrived in Susa and brought Darius' bride into his house, he lost interest in Masistes' wife. Instead, he changed his mind and pursued the young Artaynte, who was both Darius' wife and Masistes' daughter, eventually winning her over. 
109. As time passed, the truth eventually came to light in the following way. Xerxes' wife, Amestris, wove a beautiful, brightly colored cloak that amazed everyone who saw it. Xerxes was delighted with the cloak and wore it when he went to see Artaynte. Pleased with her as well, he asked her what she wanted in return for her favors, promising that he would give her anything she asked for. Unaware of the impending misfortune for her and her family, Artaynte asked Xerxes if he would truly give her whatever she requested. He agreed, thinking she wouldn't ask for the cloak. However, when he swore to fulfill her request, she boldly asked for the cloak. Xerxes tried to refuse her, fearing that Amestris would discover the truth about his relationship with Artaynte. Instead, he offered her cities, abundant gold, and even an army that only she could command, as armies are considered the most prestigious gifts in Persia. But when he couldn't change her mind, he reluctantly gave her the cloak. Overjoyed with the gift, Artaynte proudly showed off her new possession. 
110. Amestris found out that Artaynte had received the cloak, but when she learned the truth, she wasn't angry with the girl. Instead, she believed that the girl's mother was responsible for the situation and decided to plot against Masistes' wife. She waited for the perfect opportunity, which was when Xerxes would be hosting his annual royal feast. This banquet takes place once a year on the king's birthday and is called "tukta" in Persian, which means "perfect" in Greek. On this day, the king anoints his head and gives gifts to the Persians. Waiting for this day, Amestris asked Xerxes to give her Masistes' wife. Xerxes thought it was a terrible and wicked request to hand over his brother's wife, especially since she was innocent of any wrongdoing. He knew the real reason behind Amestris' request. 
111. Despite Amestris' persistence and the law that required him to fulfill any request made during the royal banquet, Xerxes reluctantly agreed and handed over Masistes' wife to Amestris. He then told his brother to do as he wished and called for Masistes. Xerxes said, "Masistes, you are Darius' son, my brother, and a good man. Listen to me. You must no longer live with your current wife. Instead, I offer you my daughter as your new wife. Please let go of your current wife, as it is not my wish for you to be with her." Masistes was shocked and replied, "Sire, why do you give me such a terrible order, telling me to leave my wife? I have sons and daughters with her, and you have even married one of our daughters to your son. I am very happy with my wife. Why do you ask me to leave her and marry your daughter? Indeed, O king, I am honored to be considered worthy of your daughter, but I cannot do either of these things. Please do not force me to agree to this. You can find another suitable husband for your daughter, but let me keep my wife."  Xerxes became very angry and said, "Masistes, because of your refusal, you will not marry my daughter, and you will no longer live with your current wife. This will teach you to accept what is offered to you." Upon hearing this, Masistes replied, "No, sire, you have not destroyed me yet!" and left. 
112. While Xerxes was talking to his brother, Amestris called for Xerxes' guards and brutally tortured Masistes' wife. She cut off the woman's breasts and fed them to dogs, as well as her nose, ears, and lips. She also removed her tongue. After this horrifying experience, Amestris sent the mutilated woman back to her home. 
113. Unaware of what had happened, but fearing something terrible, Masistes rushed home. When he saw the horrific state of his wife, he quickly discussed plans with his children. He decided to head to Bactra with his sons and others, intending to incite a revolt in the province of Bactra and cause significant harm to the king. In my opinion, he would have succeeded if he had managed to reach the lands of the Bactrians and Sacae, as they were fond of him and he was their viceroy. However, it was not meant to be. Xerxes discovered Masistes' intentions and sent an army to stop him. They killed Masistes, his sons, and his forces during their journey. This is the story of Xerxes' love and the tragic death of Masistes. 
114. The Greeks who had left Mykale for the Hellespont first stopped at Lectum due to unfavorable winds. From there, they arrived at Abydos, expecting to find the bridges still intact. In fact, the bridges were the main reason for their journey to the Hellespont. However, they discovered that the bridges had been destroyed. The Peloponnesians, led by Leutychides, decided to sail back to Hellas, while the Athenians, under the command of Xanthippus, chose to stay and attack the Chersonesus. As the rest of the Greeks sailed away, the Athenians crossed over to the Chersonesus and began their siege of Sestus. 
115. When the Persians heard that the Greeks were at the Hellespont, they gathered at Sestus from nearby towns, as it was the most fortified place in the area. A Persian named Oeobazus from Cardia was among them, and he had brought the bridge equipment with him. Although Sestus was controlled by the local Aeolians, there were also Persians and a large number of their allies present. 
116. This region was governed by Xerxes' viceroy, Artayctes, who was a cunning and wicked man. He had deceived the king during his march to Athens by stealing the treasure of Protesilaus, son of Iphiclus, from Elaeus. In the Chersonesus, there was a tomb of Protesilaus with a surrounding area containing valuable treasures, such as gold and silver vessels, bronze, clothing, and other offerings. Artayctes took all of these items with the king's permission. He deceitfully told Xerxes, "Sire, there is a house here belonging to a certain Greek who deservedly died for invading your land with an army. Please give me this man's house so that everyone learns not to invade your territory." Xerxes, not suspecting Artayctes' true intentions, easily agreed to give him the house. Artayctes claimed that Protesilaus had invaded the king's territory because the Persians believed that all of Asia belonged to them and their king.  After receiving the treasure, Artayctes moved it from Elaeus to Sestus and cultivated the land around the shrine. He would also visit the shrine from Elaeus and engage in intimate relations with women there. When the Athenians besieged him, he was unprepared, as he did not expect the Greeks to come and had no way to escape their attack. 
117. As the siege went on until late autumn, the Athenians became tired of being away from home and not being able to capture the fortress. They asked their generals to take them back, but the generals insisted they would only leave once they had captured the place or received orders from the Athenian government. With this, the soldiers accepted their situation and continued to endure patiently. 
118. The people inside the walls were in a desperate situation, so much so that they had to boil the straps from their beds for food. Eventually, even these ran out, and Artayctes, Oeobazus, and all the Persians decided to escape from the least guarded part of the fortress at night. When morning arrived, the locals from the Chersonese informed the Athenians about what had happened from their towers and opened their gates. Most of the Athenians went after the fleeing Persians, while the rest stayed behind to secure the town. 
119. While Oeobazus was trying to escape to Thrace, the local Apsinthians captured him and sacrificed him to their land's god, Plistorus, according to their custom. His companions were killed by other means. Artayctes and his group started their escape later and were caught just beyond the Goat's Rivers. After a long fight, some were killed, and the rest were captured alive. The Greeks tied them up and brought them to Sestus, along with Artayctes and his son, who were also bound. 
120. The people of the Chersonese tell a story about a strange event that happened to one of the guards watching over Artayctes. The guard was frying dried fish, and suddenly, the fish started to move and twist as if they were freshly caught. Everyone gathered around, amazed by the sight. When Artayctes saw this, he called the guard and said, "Athenian, don't be afraid of this strange event. It's not a message for you, but for me. Protesilaus of Elaeus is showing me that even though he's dead, he has the power to take revenge on me for the wrong I did to him. So, I offer a hundred talents to the god for the treasure I took from his temple. I'll also pay the Athenians two hundred talents to spare me and my son." However, Xanthippus, the general, wasn't moved by this offer. The people of Elaeus wanted Artayctes to be executed as revenge for Protesilaus, and the general agreed. They took Artayctes to the headland where Xerxes had built a bridge across the strait (or, according to another story, to a hill above the town of Madytus) and nailed him to boards and hanged him. As for his son, they stoned him to death in front of his father's eyes. 
121. After completing their tasks, they set sail back to Greece, taking with them the bridge cables to be placed in their temples, along with various other items. That concludes the events of that year. 
122. Artayctes, who was crucified, was the grandson of Artembares. Artembares once advised the Persians to present a plan to Cyrus, which went like this: "Since Zeus has granted the Persian people power and leadership, and you, Cyrus, are our leader, let's conquer Astyages and leave our small, rough land for a better one. There are many better lands nearby and farther away. By doing this, we'll gain more fame. It's reasonable for a ruling nation to act this way, especially now when we have control over so many people and all of Asia." Cyrus listened to their plan and didn't find it surprising. He said, "Go ahead and do this, but be ready to become subjects instead of rulers. Rich lands create soft people; great crops and brave warriors don't come from the same land." The Persians realized that Cyrus's reasoning was better than theirs, so they left, preferring to be rulers on a barren mountainside rather than living in fertile valleys as slaves to others.
