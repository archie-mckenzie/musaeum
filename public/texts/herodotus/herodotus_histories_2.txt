1. After Cyrus passed away, his son Cambyses inherited the throne. He was the son of Cyrus and Cassandane, daughter of Pharnaspes, whom Cyrus had mourned deeply when she died before him, and had all his subjects mourn as well. Cambyses was the son of this woman and Cyrus, and he viewed the Ionians and Aeolians as slaves inherited from his father. He prepared an expedition against Egypt, taking some of these Greek subjects with him, as well as others he ruled over.
2. Before Psammetichus became king of Egypt, the Egyptians believed they were the oldest people on earth. But since Psammetichus wanted to find out which people were the oldest, they started believing the Phrygians were older than them. Unable to learn which people had first come into being, Psammetichus took two newborn children of the common people and gave them to a shepherd to bring up among his flocks. He instructed the shepherd to not speak a word in their hearing, to keep them in a lonely hut, and to provide them with goats' milk and everything else they needed. After two years, when the shepherd opened the door to the hut, the children ran to him, stretching out their hands and calling "Bekos!" The shepherd kept quiet about it at first, but after hearing the same word often, he told his master and brought the children to the king. Psammetichus heard them himself and asked what language the word "Bekos" belonged to; he found it to be a Phrygian word meaning bread. This made the Egyptians acknowledge that the Phrygians were older than them. This story was told to me by the priests of Hephaestus' temple at Memphis; the Greeks say, among many foolish things, that Psammetichus had the children reared by women whose tongues he had cut out.
3. I heard many stories at Memphis from the priests of Hephaestus, and I also visited Thebes and Heliopolis to see if the people there would tell me the same stories. The people of Heliopolis are said to be the most learned of the Egyptians. I won't tell the stories I heard about the gods, except for their names, since I think everyone knows them. I'll only say what I'm required to by the course of my history.
4. All agreed that the Egyptians were the first to measure time in years and divide the year into twelve months. They said the Egyptians figured this out from the stars, and their system was more accurate than the Greeks', who added an extra month every other year to make the seasons match the calendar. The Egyptians also named twelve gods, which the Greeks later adopted, and built altars, images, and temples for them, as well as carving figures into stone. They showed me that this was true. They said the first human king of Egypt was Min, and at that time, all of Egypt except the Thebaic district was a marsh, with the land we now see covered in water north of Lake Moeris, which is seven days' journey up the river from the sea.
5. I believe the account of the country to be true. Even if one has not heard of it before, it is easy to see, if one has sense, that Egypt, which the Greeks sail to, is a land gifted by the river - not only the lower country, but even the land three days' voyage above the lake, which is of the same nature, though the priests did not mention this. The nature of the land of Egypt is such that when you approach it from the sea and are still a day's sail away, if you drop a sounding line, you will bring up mud from a depth of eleven fathoms, indicating that the deposit from the land reaches that far.
6. In Egypt, the coastline stretches from the Plinthinete gulf to the Serbonian marsh, located beneath the Casian mountain, and is sixty schoeni in length. People with little land measure by feet, those with more by miles, those with much by parasangs, and those with a great abundance by schoeni. A parasang is three and three quarters miles, and a schoenus, an Egyptian measure, is twice that.
7. Egypt's seaboard is 450 miles long. From the sea to Heliopolis, Egypt is a flat, watery, marshy land. The journey from the altar of the twelve gods at Athens to the temple of Olympian Zeus at Pisa is almost the same length as the journey from the sea to Heliopolis - only two miles shorter, to be exact. The distance between the sea and Heliopolis is two hundred miles, and the journey from Athens to Pisa is two miles short of two hundred.
8. Egypt is a narrow land beyond and above Heliopolis, bounded on one side by the mountains of Arabia, which run north to south and contain the quarries hewn out for the pyramids at Memphis. These mountains are two months' journey wide from east to west and yield frankincense at their easternmost boundaries. On the side of Libya, Egypt is bounded by another range of rocky mountains, all covered with sand and running in the same direction as the Arabian hills. There is no great distance between these mountain ranges, with the land being level and the plain being no more than thirty miles wide at its narrowest point. Beyond this, Egypt is a wide land again, with a length of only fourteen days' journey up the river.
9. It takes nine days to travel by river from Heliopolis to Thebes, a distance of 608 miles or 81 schoeni. The seaboard of Egypt is 450 miles long, and the distance inland from the sea to Thebes is 765 miles. Additionally, there are 225 miles between Thebes and the city of Elephantine.
10. Most of the country I spoke of was, according to the priests, land deposited by the Egyptians, and I agreed. Everything between the mountain ranges near Memphis seemed to me to have once been a gulf of the sea, just like the areas around Ilion, Teuthrania, Ephesus, and the Maeander Plain. None of the rivers that created these lands can compare to the Nile, which has five mouths. Other rivers, not as big as the Nile, have had a great impact too; I could name them, but the Achelous stands out, flowing through Acarnania and into the sea, making half of the Echinades Islands into mainland.
11. In Arabia, not far from Egypt, lies the Red Sea, a gulf that extends inland from the sea. It takes a ship rowed by oars forty days to sail from its inner end to the wide sea, and half a day to cross it at its widest point. The tides ebb and flow in it every day. I believe that where Egypt is now, there was once another such gulf, extending from the northern sea towards Aethiopia, and the other, the Arabian gulf, extending from the south towards Syria. These two gulfs were close to each other, separated by a small strip of land. If the Nile were to direct its current into this Arabian gulf, it would be silted up within twenty thousand years, and I expect it would be silted up within ten thousand years. It's not hard to imagine that a much larger gulf than this could have been silted up by a river as great and busy as the Nile in the ages before my birth.
12. I'm inclined to believe what people say about Egypt; I've seen for myself how it juts out into the sea, and the shells on the mountains, and the salt coating everything, even the pyramids. The only sandy mountain in Egypt is the one above Memphis. Egypt is nothing like the neighboring lands of Arabia, Libya, or Syria (where Syrians live on the Arabian coast). It's a land of black, crumbling earth, like it's been washed down from Aethiopia. Libya's soil is redder and a bit sandy, and Arabia and Syria are made of clay and stones.
13. When I heard this from the priests, I was reminded of the proof of Egypt's strength: when Moeris was king, the Nile would rise as much as thirteen feet and flood all of Egypt below Memphis. But now, the river must rise at least twenty-six or twenty-five feet for the land to be flooded. I believe that the Egyptians who live in the Delta and lower down the river than Lake Moeris will be in the same situation as the Greeks, who rely on rain for their water, not river water. The Egyptians once said that the Greeks would be let down by what they counted on and starve if there was no rain, for they have no other source of water except Zeus.
14. The Egyptians' prediction about the Greeks was accurate. Now, let me show the future for the Egyptians themselves: if the area below Memphis, which is rising, continues to increase in height at the same rate, won't the Egyptians living there go hungry since there is no rain in their country and the river won't be able to flood their fields? Currently, there is no one in Egypt or the world who farms with less effort than the Egyptians. They don't need to plow, hoe, or do any other labor to get a crop; the river rises on its own, waters the fields, and then recedes. Each person sows their field and sends pigs to trample the seed, then waits for the harvest. After that, they have the pigs thresh the grain and store it.
15. If we agree with the Ionians that the Delta is the only part of Egypt, stretching from the Watchtower of Perseus to the Salters' at Pelusium and inland to the city of Cercasorus, where the Nile divides and flows to Pelusium and Canobus, and that the rest of Egypt is part Libya and part Arabia, then we can show that there was once no land for the Egyptians. As the Egyptians themselves say, and as I myself judge, the Delta is alluvial land and only recently came into being. Therefore, it was an unfounded notion that they were the oldest nation on earth, and they had no need to test what language the children would first speak. I believe that the Egyptians did not come into existence with the Delta, but have been around since the beginning of the human race. As the land expanded, some stayed behind and some spread out over it. The Theban district, a land of seven hundred and sixty-five miles in circumference, was once known as Egypt.
16. If our judgement is correct, the Ionians are wrong about Egypt. But if they're right, then it's clear that the Greeks, who divide the world into three parts - Europe, Asia, and Libya - have to add a fourth part: the Delta of Egypt. It can't belong to either Asia or Libya, because the Nile doesn't separate them; it splits at the apex of the Delta, so this land must be between Asia and Libya.
17. We can set aside the Ionians' opinion and come to our own conclusion: Egypt is the country inhabited by Egyptians, just like Cilicia and Assyria are inhabited by Cilicians and Assyrians, and there is no border between Asia and Libya except the Egyptians'. But if we follow the Greeks' belief, we can divide Egypt from the Cataracts and the city of Elephantine into two parts, one part of Libya and the other of Asia. The Nile, starting from the Cataracts, divides Egypt into two parts as it flows to the sea. Up until the city Cercasorus, the Nile flows in one channel, but after that it splits into three. One of these, called the Pelusian mouth, flows east, the second, called the Canobic mouth, flows west, and the third, the Sebennytic mouth, flows straight through the middle of the Delta into the sea, and is the most famous part of the Nile. There are also two channels that branch off from the Sebennytic and flow into the sea: the Saïtic and the Mendesian. The Bolbitine and Bucolic mouths are not natural, but man-made.
18. My opinion that Egypt is vast was confirmed by the response of the Oracle of Ammon. The people of Marea and Apis, located in the part of Egypt bordering Libya, believed themselves to be Libyans and not Egyptians, and they wanted to be allowed to eat all foods, which was forbidden by religious law. So they sent a message to Ammon asking to be excluded from Egypt. But the god said that all the land watered by the Nile was Egypt, and all who lived lower than the city of Elephantine and drank the river's water were Egyptians.
19. When the Nile floods, it overflows not only the Delta but also the lands called Libyan and Arabian, sometimes as far as two days' journey from either bank, sometimes more, sometimes less. I was curious to learn why the Nile rises for a hundred days from the summer solstice and then sinks again with a diminishing stream, staying low for the whole winter until the summer solstice returns. I asked the Egyptians what power the Nile has to be so different from other rivers, and why no breezes blew from it like from other rivers, but I couldn't get any answers.
20. Some Greeks wanted to be seen as clever, so they put forward three opinions about the Nile River. I won't mention two of them, but one of them was that the Etesian winds caused the river to flood because they prevented it from emptying into the sea. However, there are times when the Etesian winds don't blow, yet the Nile still behaves the same. Additionally, if the Etesian winds were the cause, then other rivers that flow against them should be affected like the Nile, even more so since they have weaker currents. But there are many rivers in Syria and Libya that don't act like the Nile.
21. The second opinion is less based on facts than the first, but it sounds more amazing: it claims that the river does what it does because it comes from the Ocean, which circles the entire world.
22. The third opinion is the most erroneous of all, having no more truth than the others. It claims the Nile flows from where snow melts, but it actually flows from Libya through Ethiopia and into Egypt. Reasoning this through, it's clear that the river cannot flow from snow, as it comes from the hottest places to cooler lands. Furthermore, the winds blowing from Libya and Ethiopia are hot, the country is rainless and frostless, and the people are black due to the heat. Additionally, kites, swallows, and cranes live there all year round and come to winter there, flying from the wintry weather of Scythia. If there were even the slightest snowfall in the country where the Nile rises, none of this would be possible, as necessity proves.
23. The opinion about Ocean is shrouded in mystery and doesn't need to be disproven; I'm not aware of any Ocean river, so I assume Homer or some earlier poet made up this name and used it in their poetry.
24. After condemning the proposed opinions, I must state my own thoughts on these mysterious matters. I believe the Nile floods in the summer because during the winter, the sun is pushed away from its usual path and travels over the interior of Libya. To put it simply, the land is desperate for water and the rivers are dried up.
25. As the air is always clear and the land warm in Libya, the sun passes through the middle of the sky and draws up water from the Nile. This water is then expelled away to the inland regions and caught by the south and southwest winds, which are the most rainy of all. I believe the sun keeps some of the water near itself, and when winter becomes milder, it draws from all rivers alike. Other rivers swell with the rain that falls into them, but the Nile, being fed by no rain and only drawn up by the sun in winter, falls short of its summer height. Naturally, this is because in summer all other waters are attracted to the sun, but in winter it is only the Nile that is affected.
26. I am certain that the sun is the cause of this phenomenon. The sun's heat also causes the air in these parts to be dry; thus, it is always summer in the interior of Libya. If the seasons were reversed, so that the south wind and summer were in the place of the north wind and winter, and vice versa, the sun would pass over Europe as it does Libya now, and I believe it would have the same effect on the Ister River as it does on the Nile.
27. I believe the reason why no breeze blows from the river is because it is not natural for a breeze to come from a very hot place; breezes always come from something that is very cold.
28. Let this be as it was in the beginning. When I asked Egyptians, Libyans, and Greeks about the sources of the Nile, no one could tell me except the recorder of the sacred treasures of Athena in the Egyptian city of Saïs. I thought he was joking when he said he had exact knowledge, but he told me that between the city of Syene in the Thebaid and Elephantine, there are two hills with sharp peaks, Crophi and Mophi, and the bottomless springs of the Nile rise between them, half flowing north towards Egypt and the other half south towards Ethiopia. He said that Psammetichus king of Egypt had tested whether the springs were bottomless by having a rope of many thousand fathoms' length woven and let down into the spring, but he couldn't reach the bottom. This recorder showed, I think, that there are strong eddies and an upward flow of water, such that with the stream rushing against the hills the sounding-line can't reach bottom.
29. I was unable to learn anything from anyone else, so I decided to investigate as far as I could, travelling to the city of Elephantine and beyond, asking questions and listening to hearsay. Beyond Elephantine, the land rises and the river is so strong that boats must be roped on both sides like an ox, or else they will be swept away. This part of the river is a four-day journey by boat, and the Nile is as twisty as the Maeander, taking twelve schoeni to pass. After that, you come to a level plain with an island called Takhompso, which is half inhabited by Ethiopians and half by Egyptians. Near the island is a great lake, where nomadic Ethiopians live, and after crossing this, you come to the stream of the Nile. You must disembark and walk along the river bank for forty days, as there are sharp rocks and reefs that no boat can pass. After forty days, you take a boat again and travel for twelve days until you come to a great city called Meroe, which is said to be the capital of all Ethiopia. The people of the place worship only Zeus and Dionysus, honoring them greatly and sending out armies whenever the god commands them through his oracle.
30. From this city, you can take a journey by water that is the same distance as the one from Elephantine to the capital city of Ethiopia. You will arrive at the land of the Deserters, who are called Asmakh in Greek, meaning "those who stand on the left hand of the king". Two hundred and forty thousand Egyptians of fighting age revolted and joined the Ethiopians during the reign of Psammetichus. This was because the Egyptians had been on guard duty at watchposts at Elephantine, Daphnae of Pelusium, and Marea for three years without any relief, so they organized and rebelled against Psammetichus and went to Ethiopia. When Psammetichus caught up to them, he begged them not to abandon their families and gods, but one of them pointed to his genitals and said that wherever that was, they would have wives and children. The king of Ethiopia welcomed them and gave them land to occupy in return, and the Ethiopians who were displaced learned Egyptian customs and became more gentle through intermixing with the Egyptians.
31. It takes four months to travel by land and water to get to the Nile, apart from the part of it that is in Egypt. According to calculations, it takes that long to get from Elephantine to the country of the Deserters. The river flows from the west and the sun sets there. Beyond that, no one has any clear information; the whole area is desolate due to the heat.
32. I heard from some men of Cyrene that they had gone to the oracle of Ammon and spoken with Etearchus, the king of the Ammonians. The conversation had turned to the Nile and how no one knows its source. Etearchus told them that he had been visited by some Nasamonians, a Libyan people living near the Syrtis. The Nasamonians said that some of their leading men's sons, proud and violent youths, had chosen five of their company to visit the Libyan desert and see if they could see further than those who had seen the farthest. The northern seacoast of Libya, from Egypt to the promontory of Soloeis, is inhabited by Libyans, except for the parts held by Greeks and Phoenicians. The region above the sea and the inhabitants of the coast are plagued by wild beasts, and beyond that is a desolate, waterless desert. The young men, well supplied with water and provisions, traveled through the inhabited country and then the wild-beast region. After crossing a wide sandy region, they eventually saw trees in a plain and were met by little men of less than average height who took them away. The Nasamonians couldn't understand the language of their guides, and vice versa. The men led them across great marshes and then to a city where all the people were of the same small stature and black. A great river ran past the city, from the west to the east, and crocodiles could be seen in it.
33. Etearchus the Ammonian had told me enough of the story, except that the Nasamonians had returned, as the men of Cyrene had said, and that the people they had come to were all wizards. Etearchus guessed that the river running past the city was the Nile, and reason supports this. The Nile flows from Libya, right through the middle of it, and I reasoned that it must rise as far away as the Ister. The Ister flows from the land of the Celts and the city of Pyrene, through the middle of Europe, and ends its course in the Euxine Sea at Istria, which is inhabited by Milesian colonists. The Celts live beyond the Pillars of Heracles, being neighbors of the Cynesii, who are the westernmost of all the peoples inhabiting Europe.
34. The Ister River is well-known since it flows through inhabited areas, but no one can tell of the source of the Nile since Libya, where it runs, is uninhabited and desert. I have related all I could learn through inquiry about its course, and it empties into Egypt. Egypt is located opposite the mountainous part of Cilicia; it's a five-day journey for an unencumbered person to Sinope on the Euxine Sea from there, and Sinope is opposite the place where the Ister River meets the sea. I assume the course of the Nile through Libya is similar to the course of the Ister.
35. It's enough to say a few words about the Nile, but I'm going to talk at length about Egypt, because it's full of wonders and its sights are indescribable. Egypt has its own climate and its river is unlike any other. Its customs and laws are mostly different from the rest of the world. Women buy and sell, while men stay home and weave, but unlike other weavers, the Egyptians push the woof downwards. Men carry burdens on their heads, while women carry them on their shoulders. Women stand to urinate, while men sit. They do their private business indoors and eat in the streets, believing that things that are unseemly should be done in private, and things that are not unseemly should be done openly. No woman is dedicated to any god or goddess, but men are dedicated to all deities, male or female. Sons are not forced to support their parents, but daughters must do so, even if they don't want to.
36. Priests of the gods everywhere else wear their hair long, but in Egypt they are shaven. In mourning for the dead, those most closely affected usually have their heads shaven, but Egyptians shave at other times and let their hair and beard grow after a death. Egyptians are the only people who keep their animals in the house, and while everyone else lives on wheat and barley, it is a great disgrace for an Egyptian to do so; they make food from a grain called spelt. They knead dough with their feet and gather mud and dung with their hands. Egyptians and those who have learned from them are the only people who practice circumcision. Every man has two garments and every woman only one. Rings and sheets of sails are usually made fast outside the boat, but in Egypt they are made fast inside. Greeks write and calculate from left to right, while Egyptians do the opposite, though they say their way of writing is towards the right and the Greek way towards the left. They use two kinds of writing, one called sacred and the other demotic.
37. The Egyptians are incredibly religious, and have many customs. They drink from bronze cups which they clean out daily, and they always wear freshly washed linen. They practice circumcision for cleanliness, and their priests shave their entire bodies every other day to ensure they are free of lice and other impurities while attending to the gods. The priests wear a single linen garment and sandals of papyrus, and they wash twice a day and twice every night in cold water. Their religious observances are innumerable. They receive many benefits, such as food and wine, but they are not allowed to eat fish or beans, which are considered unclean. Each god has many priests, one of whom is the high priest, and when the high priest dies, his son takes his place.
38. The people of Epaphus believe that bulls belong to them, so they inspect them carefully. If they find even one black hair, the bull is considered impure. A priest is assigned to examine the animal, making it stand and lie down, and pulling out its tongue to check for signs of impurity. He also looks at the hairs of the tail to make sure they grow naturally. If the bull passes the inspection, the priest marks it by wrapping papyrus around the horns, smearing it with sealing-earth, and stamping it with his ring. If someone sacrifices a bull that hasn't been marked, they face the death penalty. After the bull is approved, it is sacrificed in a certain way.
39. Leading the marked beast to the altar, they kindled a fire and poured wine over the victim, calling upon the god. They then cut its throat and severed the head from the body, flaying the carcass and invoking many curses on its head, which they carried away. If there was a market with Greek traders, the head was taken there and sold; if not, it was thrown into the river. As they uttered the imprecation, they wished that whatever ill threatened those who sacrificed or the whole of Egypt would fall upon that head. All Egyptians followed the same practice in all sacrifices, abstaining from the head of anything that had life.
40. When it comes to disemboweling and burning the victims, there is a different way for each sacrifice. Now, I will talk about the goddess they consider the greatest and celebrate with the highest festival. After praying, they take out the whole stomach of the flayed bull, leaving the entrails and fat in the carcass, and cut off the legs, the end of the loin, the shoulders, and the neck. They fill the remaining carcass with pure bread, honey, raisins, figs, frankincense, myrrh, and other kinds of incense, and then burn it, pouring a lot of oil on it. Before the sacrifice, they fast and while it is burning, they all make lamentation. When their lamentation is over, they set out a meal of what is left of the victim.
41. All Egyptians sacrifice unblemished bulls and bull-calves, but cows are sacred to Isis, so they cannot be sacrificed. This is because the images of Isis are in woman's form, horned like a cow, just like the Greeks picture Io, and cows are held as the most sacred of all beasts of the herd by all Egyptians. For this reason, no Egyptian man or woman will kiss a Greek man, use a knife, spit, or cauldron belonging to a Greek, or taste the flesh of an unblemished bull that has been cut up with a Greek knife. When cattle die, cows are cast into the river and bulls are buried in the suburbs of each city, with one or both horns uncovered as a sign. Then, when the carcass is decomposed and the appointed time is near, a boat comes from the island of Prosopitis in the Delta, which is nine schoeni in circumference and has many other towns. The town from which the boats come to gather the bones of the bulls is called Atarbekhis and has a temple of Aphrodite of great sanctity. From this town, people go out to different cities to dig up the bones, which they then carry away and bury in one place. They do the same with all other beasts at death, as they may not be killed.
42. Those who have a temple of Zeus in Thebes or are from the Theban district sacrifice goats, but will not touch sheep. This is because all Egyptians worship Isis and Osiris, who they believe is Dionysus, and these gods are worshipped by all alike. On the other hand, those who have a temple of Mendes or are from the Mendesian district sacrifice sheep, but will not touch goats. The Thebans, and those who follow the Theban example, explain their ordinance by saying that Heracles wanted to see Zeus, but Zeus did not want to be seen. Eventually, when Heracles prayed, Zeus showed himself with the head and fleece of a ram that he had flayed and beheaded. This is why the Egyptian images of Zeus have a ram's head, and why the Ammonians, who are colonists from Egypt and Ethiopia and speak a language of both countries, imitate this. The Thebans consider rams sacred for this reason and do not sacrifice them. However, on one day a year at the festival of Zeus, they cut up and flay a single ram, put the fleece on the image of Zeus, and bring an image of Heracles near it. After this, everyone at the temple mourns for the ram and buries it in a sacred coffin.
43. I heard it said that Heracles was one of the twelve gods, but I couldn't find any information about the other Heracles, the one the Greeks know. I have plenty of evidence that the name of Heracles didn't come from Greece to Egypt, but from Egypt to Greece, and that Amphitryon and Alcmene, Heracles' parents, were both of Egyptian descent. The Egyptians don't know the names Poseidon or the Dioscuri, and these gods aren't part of their pantheon. If they got any names from the Greeks, they would have remembered them, especially since they were already sailing and some Greeks were seafarers. But Heracles is an ancient god in Egypt; the Egyptians say that the change from eight gods to twelve, with Heracles as one of them, happened seventeen thousand years before the reign of Amasis.
44. I wanted to get clear information about this matter, so I took a ship to Tyre in Phoenicia, where I had heard there was a holy temple of Heracles. When I arrived, I saw the temple was richly equipped with offerings, including two pillars, one of gold and one of emerald, and a great pillar that shone at night. I asked the priests how long ago the temple was built, and they said it was two thousand three hundred years ago, which didn't match up with what the Greeks believed. I also visited Thasos, where I found a temple of Heracles built by the Phoenicians, who had settled there five generations before the birth of Heracles in Hellas. This showed me that Heracles is an ancient god, and the Greeks who worship him as both an immortal and a dead hero are right.
45. The Greeks tell many ill-considered stories, including one about Heracles' time in Egypt. They say that the Egyptians crowned him and led him in a procession to sacrifice him to Zeus. He followed quietly until they reached the altar, but then he resisted and killed them all. This story shows the Greeks' ignorance of the Egyptians' character and customs, as they are forbidden to sacrifice anything but swine, bulls, bull-calves, and unblemished geese. Furthermore, it is unlikely that Heracles, alone and only a man, could have killed so many. I hope I have not offended the gods and heroes in speaking of this.
46. The Egyptians I spoke of don't sacrifice goats, male or female, because the Mendesians believe Pan is one of the eight gods who came before the twelve gods. In their art, Pan is depicted with the head and legs of a goat, like the Greeks, but not because they think he actually looks like that; why they portray him that way, I won't say. Goats are considered sacred by the Mendesians, the males even more so than the females, and goatherds are held in high regard. One he-goat is the most sacred of all; when he dies, it's customary for the whole Mendesian district to mourn. In Egyptian, Mendes is the name for both the he-goat and Pan. Something strange happened in this district during my lifetime: a he-goat had intercourse with a woman, and it became public knowledge.
47. The Egyptians consider swine to be unclean beasts. If an Egyptian touches a hog, they must go to the river and dip themselves in it, even if they are fully clothed. Swineherds, who are native Egyptians, are the only people forbidden to enter any Egyptian temple, and no one will give their daughter in marriage to a swineherd or take a wife from their women. Swineherds only marry each other. The Egyptians only sacrifice swine to the Moon and Dionysus, and they do so during the full moon. They explain why they sacrifice swine at this festival but not at others, but it is not appropriate to share this explanation. To sacrifice swine to the Moon, the sacrificer puts the end of the tail, the spleen, the caul, and all the fat around the belly together and consigns it to the fire. The rest of the flesh is eaten at the time of the full moon. Poor people with limited resources make swine out of dough and sacrifice them.
48. On the evening of his festival, Dionysus is offered a piglet which he kills before his door and then gives to the swineherd who sold it, for them to take away. The Egyptians observe the rest of the festival much like the Greeks, except for the dances; instead, they use puppets two feet high, with a male member that nods and is nearly as big as the rest of the body. These puppets are carried around the villages by women, with a flute-player leading the way and the women singing of Dionysus behind them. There is a sacred legend that explains why the male member is so large and is the only part of the body that moves.
49. It appears to me that Melampus, son of Amytheon, was not ignorant of this sacrifice. He was the one who taught the Greeks the name of Dionysus and the way of sacrificing to him, as well as the phallic procession. He did not reveal all the details, but the teachers who followed him did. It was from Melampus that the Greeks learned to bear the phallus in honor of Dionysus, and they got their current practice from him. I believe that Melampus was a discerning man and acquired the prophetic art, and he learned many things from Egypt, including the worship of Dionysus. I will not say that what is done in Egypt and what is done among the Greeks originated independently, nor will I say that the Egyptians took this or any other custom from the Greeks. Rather, I believe that Melampus learned the worship of Dionysus mainly from Cadmus of Tyre and those who came with him from Phoenicia to Boeotia.
50. I'm convinced that nearly all the gods' names came to Greece from Egypt. Except for Poseidon, the Dioscuri, Hera, Hestia, Themis, the Graces, and the Nereids, all the gods' names have always been in Egypt. That's what the Egyptians say. The Pelasgians named the gods whose names the Egyptians don't know, except for Poseidon, which the Libyans taught them. The Libyans are the only people who have always known Poseidon's name and honored him. The Egyptians, however, don't pay any respect to heroes.
51. The Greeks adopted many customs from the Egyptians, but the ithyphallic images of Hermes were a Pelasgian invention. The Athenians were the first Greeks to take it from them, and then passed it on to others. The Athenians were already considered Greeks when the Pelasgians arrived and settled among them. Those initiated into the rites of the Cabeiri, which the Samothracians learned from the Pelasgians, will understand what I mean. Samothrace was originally inhabited by the Pelasgians who had come to live with the Athenians, and it is from them that the Samothracians take their rites. The Athenians were the first Greeks to make ithyphallic images of Hermes, and they did this because the Pelasgians taught them a sacred tale about it, which is set forth in the Samothracian mysteries.
52. The Pelasgians used to call upon gods in their sacrifices without giving them any name or title, as they had not yet heard of such. They referred to them as gods because they believed they were responsible for setting everything in order and maintaining all the dispositions. After a long while, they learned the names of the gods from Egypt, and much later, the name of Dionysus. They then asked the oracle at Dodona, the oldest in Hellas, if they should adopt the foreign names, and the oracle told them to use them. From then on, they used the names of the gods in their sacrifices, and the Greeks later adopted them from the Pelasgians.
53. Until recently, no one knew where the gods had come from, or if they had always been around, or what they looked like. Hesiod and Homer, who lived about four hundred years before me, taught the Greeks about the gods' descent, gave them their names, and described their roles and appearances. But the poets who were supposedly before them were actually after them, according to me. The earlier part of this story comes from the priestesses of Dodona, and the later part is what I have to say.
54. The Egyptians told me about the oracles in Hellas and Libya. The priests of Zeus of Thebes said that two priestesses had been taken away by Phoenicians - one to Libya and one to Hellas - and they were the first to set up places of divination in those countries. When I asked how they knew this, they said their people had looked for the women but never found them, and only later heard the story they were telling me.
55. I heard this story from the Theban priests: the prophetesses of Dodona said two black doves had flown from Thebes in Egypt, one to Libya and one to Dodona. The dove that came to Dodona settled on an oak tree and spoke in human language, saying a place of divination from Zeus should be made there. The people of Dodona understood this was a divine message and so they created the oracle. The dove that went to Libya told the Libyans to make an oracle of Ammon, which is also sacred to Zeus. This is what the Dodonaean priestesses, Promeneia, Timarete, and Nicandra, and the other temple servants believed.
56. I believe that if the Phoenicians did indeed take away the sacred women and sell one in Libya and one in Hellas, then the woman sold in what is now Hellas, but was formerly called Pelasgia, was sold in Thesprotia. It makes sense that, as she had been a handmaid of the temple of Zeus at Thebes, she would remember that temple in the land to which she had come and, once she understood the Greek language, she established a shrine of Zeus under an oak tree and taught divination. She also said that her sister had been sold in Libya by the same Phoenicians who sold her.
57. The people of Dodona called the women "doves" because they spoke a strange language that sounded like the cries of birds. When the woman spoke in a language they could understand, they said the dove spoke human speech. It was impossible for a dove to speak the language of men, so the story that the dove was black likely signifies that the woman was Egyptian.
58. The divination practices of Thebes in Egypt and Dodona are similar, and the practice of divining from a sacrificed victim also originated in Egypt. It appears that the Egyptians were the first to establish solemn assemblies, processions, and services, and the Greeks learned all of this from them. This is evident because the Egyptian ceremonies are clearly very old, while the Greek ones are more recent.
59. The Egyptians hold frequent solemn assemblies, the most enthusiastically celebrated being the one in honor of Artemis at Bubastis. The next most important is the festival of Isis at Busiris, located in the middle of the Egyptian Delta. There is a great temple of Isis, who is known as Demeter in Greek. The third greatest festival is at Saïs in honor of Athena, the fourth is the festival of the sun at Heliopolis, the fifth is for Leto at Buto, and the sixth is for Ares at Papremis.
60. As they make their way to Bubastis, people travel by river in boats, men and women together. Some of the women shake rattles, others play flutes, and the rest sing and clap their hands. Whenever they come near another town, they pull up to the bank and the women mock the women of the town, dance, and lift their skirts. When they finally reach Bubastis, they celebrate with great sacrifices and more wine than is consumed in the rest of the year. It is said that seven hundred thousand men and women (but not children) gather there for the festivities.
61. At Busiris, I have already described how they celebrate the feast of Isis. Countless men and women lament, though it would not be pious of me to say who they are mourning for. The Carians living in Egypt go even further, cutting their foreheads with knives to demonstrate that they are not Egyptians.
62. On the night of the sacrifice, the people of Saïs gather around their homes with lamps burning. These lamps are saucers filled with salt and oil, with a wick floating on top, and they stay lit all night. This is known as the Feast of Lamps. Those who don't attend the feast still keep their lamps burning throughout Egypt, so the night is illuminated everywhere. A sacred story is told to explain why this night is so special and honored.
63. When people visit Heliopolis and Buto, they offer sacrifices. At Papremis, they offer sacrifices and perform rites just like everywhere else. As the sun sets, some of the priests hover around the image while the majority stand at the entrance of the temple, each armed with a wooden club. Additionally, more than a thousand men, fulfilling vows, stand in a mass opposite them. The day before, the image of the god is placed in a little gilded wooden shrine and taken to another sacred building. The few priests left with the image draw a four-wheeled wagon carrying the shrine and the image. The others stand in front of the doors and prevent them from entering, while the vow-keepers, taking the side of the god, strike them with their clubs. A fierce fight ensues and many are hit on their heads, though the Egyptians claim that no one dies. The natives say that this custom was created from an incident involving Ares. His mother lived in the temple and when Ares, who had been raised apart from her, came to visit, the attendants kept him out. Ares then brought men from another town, manhandled the attendants, and went in to his mother. From this, they say, the hitting for Ares became a custom in the festival.
64. The Egyptians were the first to make it a religious observance to not have intercourse with women in temples or to enter a temple after such intercourse without washing. Most other peoples are less careful than the Egyptians and Greeks, believing that a man is like any other animal; they point out that beasts and birds mate in temples and sacred precincts, and if it displeased the gods, they would not do so. This is the reason given by others for practices which I personally do not agree with, but the Egyptians are extremely strict when it comes to desecrating their temples.
65. Egypt borders Libya, but it is not a country of many animals. All of them are held sacred, some living in people's households and some not. I could explain why they are left alone as sacred, but that would involve matters of divinity, which I prefer not to discuss, except when necessary. It is customary to appoint guardians to provide nourishment for each kind of animal. A son inherits this office from his father. When people pay their vows, they pray to the god to whom the animal is dedicated, shaving all or part of their children's heads and weighing the hair in a balance against a sum of silver. The weight in silver of the hair is given to the female guardian of the creatures, who buys fish with it and feeds them. If someone kills one of these creatures intentionally, they are punished with death; if they kill accidentally, they must pay whatever penalty the priests appoint. Killing an ibis or a hawk, intentionally or not, is punishable by death.
66. There are many household animals, and there would be even more if it weren't for the cats. When female cats have a litter, they become uninterested in the males, so the males have to resort to stealing, carrying off, and killing the kittens (though they don't eat them). The mothers, desperate for more offspring, will then approach the males, as they are creatures that love having babies. When a fire breaks out, the cats act strangely; the Egyptians form a broken line, more concerned with the cats than putting out the fire, but the cats slip through or jump over the people and jump into the fire. This causes great mourning in Egypt. When a cat dies naturally, the occupants of the house shave their eyebrows, but if a dog dies, they shave their whole body.
67. In the town of Bubastis, dead cats are taken away to sacred buildings, embalmed, and buried. Female dogs are buried by the townsfolk in their own towns in sacred coffins, and the same is done with mongooses. Shrewmice and hawks are taken away to Buto, ibises to the city of Hermes. There are few bears, and the wolves are only slightly bigger than foxes; both of these animals are buried wherever they are found.
68. Crocodiles have an interesting nature; they don't eat for four winter months and have four feet, allowing them to live both on land and in the water. Their eggs are not much bigger than goose eggs, yet they grow to a length of twenty-eight feet or more. They have pig-like eyes and long protruding teeth, and are the only animal without a tongue. They move their upper jaw down onto the lower, which is unique among beasts, and have strong claws and a scaly, impenetrable hide on their back. They are blind in the water, but have keen sight in the air. Their mouths are full of leeches, and all birds and beasts flee from them, except the sandpiper, which they are at peace with because it eats the leeches in their mouths when they open them to catch the west wind.
69. Some Egyptians consider crocodiles sacred, while others view them as enemies. Those living near Thebes and Lake Moeris hold them in high regard, raising one in each household and treating it with the utmost care, adorning it with glass and gold ornaments and bracelets, providing it with special food and offerings, and even embalming and burying it in a sacred coffin after death. However, in Elephantine, they are not held sacred and are even eaten. The Egyptians call them khampsae, while the Ionians named them crocodiles due to their resemblance to the lizards they have in their walls.
70. Hunting crocodiles has many methods, but the one I find most noteworthy involves baiting a hook with a hog's back and floating it into the river. The hunter stays on the bank with a young pig, which he beats to make it squeal. The sound attracts the crocodile, which swallows the bait, and the hunters pull the line. When the crocodile is drawn ashore, the hunter smears its eyes with mud, making it easier to capture. Without this step, it would be a difficult task.
71. In Papremis, hippopotamuses are held sacred, but not in the rest of Egypt. They have four cloven hooves like cattle, a blunt nose, a horse's mane, visible tusks, a horse's tail and voice, and are as big as the biggest bull. Their hide is so thick that when it is dried, it can be used to make spearshafts.
72. Otters, scale-fish, eels, and fox-geese are all considered sacred by the Egyptians, who revere them as symbols of the god of the Nile. These animals can be found in the river, and the Egyptians believe that they are blessed by the god.
73. I've never seen a phoenix, only pictures of it, and according to the people of Heliopolis, it only visits Egypt once every five hundred years. It looks like an eagle, with golden and red plumage. The story of what it does is incredible: it flies from Arabia to the temple of the Sun, carrying an egg of myrrh as heavy as it can manage. It hollows out the egg and places its father inside, then seals it with more myrrh so that it's the same weight as before, and delivers it to the temple of the Sun in Egypt.
74. Close to Thebes, there are sacred snakes that are harmless to humans and are small in size, with two horns on the top of their heads. When they die, they are buried in the temple of Zeus, who they are said to be sacred to.
75. I ventured to Buto in Arabia to learn about the winged serpents, and when I arrived, I was met with a sight of countless bones and backbones of serpents, in heaps of all sizes. This place, where the backbones lay scattered, was at the entrance of a narrow mountain pass that opened up to a great plain, adjacent to the plain of Egypt. It is said that the winged serpents fly from Arabia at the beginning of spring, heading for Egypt, but the ibis birds intercept them in the pass and kill them. The Arabians claim that the Egyptians honor the ibis birds for this service, and the Egyptians give the same reason for honoring them.
76. The ibis is all black, with the legs of a crane and a sharply hooked beak, and is as big as a landrail. There are two kinds of ibis, one that associates with humans, which has a bare head and neck, white plumage, and black head, neck, wingtips, and tail. The other kind has legs and beak like the first. The serpents they fight with are like water-snakes, with wings that are not feathered but resemble those of a bat. I have said enough about these sacred creatures.
77. The Egyptians living in the cultivated country are the most devoted to preserving the past, and none I've questioned are as knowledgeable in history. They have a three-day purging ritual every month, believing that all sicknesses come from the food they eat. They are the healthiest people next to the Libyans, likely due to the consistent climate. They eat bread called "cyllestis" made of coarse grain, and a drink made from barley instead of wine since they have no vines. Quails, ducks, and small birds are salted and eaten raw, while other birds and fish (except those considered sacred) are roasted or boiled.
78. At the feasts of the wealthy, a man carries around a coffin with an image of a corpse inside, painted and carved to look exactly like a real body two or four feet long. He shows it to each person in the room, saying, "Enjoy your drink, but remember that this is where you'll end up when you die." This is the custom at their symposia.
79. The people of Egypt keep the customs of their fathers, not adding any new ones. One of their most notable customs is the Linus-song, which is sung in Phoenicia, Cyprus, and other places. Each nation has its own name for it, but it's the same song the Greeks call Linus. This made me wonder: where did the Egyptians get Linus? It turns out they've been singing this song since the beginning; in Egyptian, it's called Maneros. The Egyptians told me Maneros was the only son of their first king, who died prematurely, and this dirge was sung in his honor. This was their earliest and only chant.
80. When Greeks encounter their elders, they follow a custom that only the Lacedaemonians share with the Egyptians: younger people step aside and stand up to show respect. But they differ from other Greeks in one way: instead of speaking to each other, they greet by lowering their hand to their knee.
81. The Egyptians wear linen tunics with fringes around the legs, called "calasiris," and white woolen mantles over them. Nothing woolen is allowed in temples or buried with them, as it is considered impious. This practice is shared by the Orphic and Bacchic rites, as well as the Egyptian and Pythagorean traditions, which forbid anyone participating in these rites to be buried in woolen wrappings. There is a sacred legend behind this belief.
82. The Egyptians are credited with originating many things, including the idea that each month and day belongs to a god, and that one's fate, end, and character are determined by the day of their birth. This concept has been explored by the Greeks in their poetry. The Egyptians have also discovered more portents than any other people; when a portent occurs, they record it and if something similar happens again, they believe it will have a similar result.
83. Divination is not practiced by any one person in Egypt, but rather by some of the gods. There are oracles of Heracles, Apollo, Athena, Artemis, Ares, and Zeus, with Leto being the most revered, located in the town of Buto. Additionally, they have multiple methods of divination, not just one.
84. Medicine is so specialized among them that each doctor specializes in one disease only. The whole country is full of physicians, some for eyes, some for teeth, some for stomach issues, and some for internal diseases.
85. When a man of note passes away, the women of the house daub their faces and heads with mud and, with their garments girt around them and their breasts showing, they leave the corpse in the house and roam the city lamenting, accompanied by the women of their relatives. The men also grieve, with their garments girt likewise. After this, they take the body to be embalmed.
86. There are men who specialize in this craft and when a dead body is brought to them, they show those who brought it wooden models of corpses, painted likenesses. They explain that the most perfect way of embalming belongs to someone whose name is too sacred to mention, and the second way is less perfect and cheaper, while the third is the least costly. After agreeing on a price, the bearers leave and the workmen embalm the body. To do this in the most perfect way, they first draw out part of the brain through the nostrils with an iron hook and inject certain drugs into the rest. Then, they make a cut near the flank with a sharp knife of Ethiopian stone, take out all the intestines, and clean the belly, rinsing it with palm wine and bruised spices. They sew it up again after filling the belly with pure ground myrrh, casia, and other spices, except frankincense. After this, they conceal the body for seventy days, embalmed in saltpetre, and when the seventy days have passed, they wash the body and wrap it in bandages of fine linen cloth, anointed with gum, which the Egyptians mostly use instead of glue. Finally, they give the dead man back to his friends who make a hollow wooden figure like a man, enclose the corpse, shut it up, and keep it safe in a coffin-chamber, placed erect against a wall.
87. The most expensive way to prepare the dead is to fill their belly with cedar oil without making a cut or removing the intestines, but injecting the fluid through the anus and preventing it from running out. This is done over a few days, and on the last day the cedar oil is drained, taking with it the internal organs and intestines, which have been dissolved by the saltpetre. In the end, nothing is left of the body but hide and bones, and the embalmers give back the dead body with no more ado.
88. For those of lesser means, the third method of embalming is to cleanse the belly with a purgative, embalm the body for seventy days, and then return it to be taken away.
89. Notable men's wives and women of great beauty and reputation are not given to the embalmers right away, but only after they have been dead for three or four days; this is done to prevent the embalmers from having sexual relations with the women. It is said that one embalmer was caught in the act with a recently deceased woman and was denounced by his colleague.
90. Anyone, Egyptian or foreign, who has been taken by a crocodile or drowned in the river must be embalmed and wrapped as beautifully as possible and buried in a sacred coffin by the people of the place where their body is found. No one from their family or friends may touch them, as their body is seen as something more than human and is handled and buried by the priests of the Nile.
91. The Egyptians generally avoid using the customs of other peoples, but there is a great city called Khemmis in the Theban district near the New City. In this city is a square temple of Perseus, son of Danae, surrounded by palm trees. Two large stone statues stand at the entrance, and in the outer court is a shrine with an image of Perseus. The people of Khemmis say that Perseus is often seen in the area and within the temple, and that his four-foot-long sandal keeps turning up, bringing prosperity to all of Egypt. They celebrate games with every kind of contest, offering animals, cloaks, and skins as prizes, which is a Greek custom. When asked why Perseus only appears to them and why they celebrate games differently than other Egyptians, they explain that Perseus is of their city, as Danaus and Lynceus, who traveled to Greece, were from Khemmis. They also tell of how Perseus came to Khemmis when he went to Egypt to bring the Gorgon's head from Libya, and how he recognized all his relatives and heard the name of Khemmis from his mother before he arrived. It was at his request, they say, that they began celebrating the games.
92. The customs of the Egyptians living above the marsh country are the same as the rest of the Egyptians, with each man having one wife, just like the Greeks. To make their food more affordable, they have devised ways to use the resources of the river. When the river floods and overflows onto the plains, many lilies, called lotus, grow in the water. They gather these and dry them in the sun, then crush the poppy-like center of the plant and bake it into loaves. The root of the lotus is also edible and has a sweetish taste, being round and the size of an apple. Other lilies that are like roses also grow in the river, with the fruit found in a calyx springing from the root by a separate stalk, and is most like a comb made by wasps, producing many edible seeds as big as olive pits, which can be eaten both fresh and dried. They also use the byblus which grows annually, gathering it from the marshes, cutting off the top for other uses, and eating or selling the lower part, about twenty inches long. Those who want to get the most out of the byblus roast it in a red-hot oven before eating. Some people even live on fish alone, catching them, taking out the intestines, then drying them in the sun and eating them dried.
93. Fish that swim in schools are rarely born in rivers; they are raised in lakes and behave in a certain way. When the urge to spawn comes, the males lead the way, releasing their milt while the females follow and swallow it to conceive. After the females become heavy with eggs, they all swim back to their own habitats, but this time the females lead the school, occasionally releasing eggs (which look like millet seeds) that the males consume as they follow. The fish that are reared come from the eggs that survive and are not eaten. Those fish that are caught while swimming out to sea have bruises on the left side of their heads, and those caught while returning have bruises on the right side. This is because they stay close to the left bank while swimming out and keep in contact with the same bank on their return, likely to avoid getting lost in the current. When the Nile begins to rise, the first places to fill are the hollow and marshy areas near the river, and they are suddenly full of little fishes. I believe these come from the eggs that the fish dropped into the mud before they left with the last of the water when the Nile fell, and when the flood returns the following year, the eggs hatch and the fish appear.
94. The Egyptians living near the marshes use oil from the castor-berry, which they call kiki. This plant, which grows wild in Hellas, is sown on the banks of rivers and lakes in Egypt and produces a lot of fruit, though it smells bad. When they harvest it, some crush and press it, while others roast it and collect the liquid that comes out. This oil is thick and useful for lamps, and it has a strong odor.
95. Those living in marshy areas have devised a way to protect themselves from the abundance of mosquitos: those living higher up build towers to sleep in, as the winds prevent the mosquitos from flying up there. Those living near the marshes, however, have a different solution: they use a net to catch fish during the day, and at night they set it up around their bed and sleep underneath it. If they were to sleep wrapped in a garment or cloth, the mosquitos would bite through it, but they cannot penetrate the net.
96. The boats they use to transport cargo are made of acacia, which is similar in shape to the lotus of Cyrene, and its sap is gum. They cut logs of four feet in length and lay them like bricks, then fasten them to long, closely-set stakes to build the boat. They don't use ribs, and they caulk the inside seams with byblus. There is one rudder that passes through a hole in the boat's keel, and the mast is made of acacia wood and the sails of byblus. These boats can't move upstream unless there's a strong breeze, so they're towed from the bank, but downstream they use a raft made of tamarisk wood, held together with reed matting, and a two-talent-weight pierced stone. The raft is connected to the boat by a rope and floats ahead of it, while the stone is connected to the back of the boat by a rope and drags along the riverbed, keeping the boat's course straight. There are many of these boats, some of which can carry up to a thousand talents.
97. When the Nile floods, only the towns remain visible above the water, much like the islands in the Aegean Sea. The rest of Egypt is submerged, so when this happens, people are not ferried along the river as usual, but instead travel across the plain. In fact, the boat going from Naucratis to Memphis passes close to the pyramids, though it does not go by there, but by the Delta's point and the town of Cercasorus. Your voyage from the sea and Canobus to Naucratis will take you over the plain near the town of Anthylla and the town of Arkhandrus.
98. Anthylla is a well-known town, especially known for providing shoes to the consort of the current king of Egypt. This has been the case since Egypt has been under Persian rule. The other town is named after Arkhandrus, son of Phthius the Achaean and son-in-law of Danaus; it's called Arkhandrus' Town. It's possible there was another Arkhandrus, but the name is not Egyptian.
99. So far, I've only been able to record my own observations and conclusions. Now I'm going to tell you what I've heard about the Egyptian chronicles. The priests said that Min was the first king of Egypt and he created the southern bend of the Nile, which is about twelve and a half miles above Memphis, by damming the river and drying up the ancient channel. To this day, the Persians keep a close eye on this bend of the river, reinforcing the dam every year to keep the current in, because if the Nile were to break through the dikes and flood this area, all of Memphis would be in danger. When Min had created dry land from what he had cut off, he first built the city of Memphis (which is in the narrow part of Egypt) and outside of it he dug a lake from the river to its north and west, with the Nile itself bounding it on the east. He also built the great and noteworthy temple of Hephaestus in the city.
100. After him came three hundred and thirty kings, whose names the priests recited from a papyrus roll. Of these many generations, eighteen were Ethiopian kings and one was a native queen, Nitocris. To avenge her brother, who was king of Egypt and was slain by his subjects, Nitocris invited those Egyptians who had been complicit in her brother's murder to a great feast. She then let the river in upon them through a secret channel and, to escape vengeance, cast herself into a chamber full of hot ashes.
101. The other kings were not remembered for any great achievements or acts, except for Moeris, the last of them. Moeris was remembered for building the northern forecourt of the temple of Hephaestus, digging a lake of a great circumference, and building pyramids there too. All of this was Moeris' work, and none of the rest had anything to be recorded about them.
102. Sesostris44 was the king who came after them, and according to the priests, he set out with a fleet of long ships45 from the Arabian Gulf and conquered all those living by the Red Sea until he reached a sea too shallow for his vessels. He then gathered a great army and marched over the mainland, subjugating every nation he encountered. When the people fought hard for their freedom, he erected pillars in their land with an inscription of his name and country, and how he had conquered them with his own power. But when the cities offered no resistance and were easily taken, he still put an inscription on the pillars, but also drew the private parts of a woman to show that the people were cowardly.
103. Sesostris marched across the country until he had crossed from Asia to Europe, defeating the Scythians and Thracians. He had gone as far as he could go; the pillars of his army can still be seen in Egypt, but nowhere else. He then turned around and headed home, and when he reached the Phasis River, he may have left some of his army there to settle, or some of his soldiers may have grown tired of his travels and stayed by the Phasis.
104. It's clear that the Colchians are Egyptians; I noticed this before I heard it from anyone else. I asked both peoples and the Colchians remembered the Egyptians better than the Egyptians remembered the Colchians. The Egyptians said they thought the Colchians were part of Sesostris' army. I figured this out partly because they have dark skin and woolly hair, but that doesn't mean much since other people do too. My better proof was that the Colchians, Egyptians, and Ethiopians are the only nations that have practiced circumcision since the beginning. The Phoenicians and Syrians of Palestine said they learned the custom from the Egyptians, and the Syrians of the valleys of the Thermodon and the Parthenius, as well as their neighbors the Macrones, said they learned it from the Colchians recently. These are the only nations that circumcise, and they do it the same way as the Egyptians. I can't say which nation learned it from the other, but it's obviously an ancient custom. It's clear that the others learned it through trade with Egypt, since Phoenicians who trade with Hellas don't imitate the Egyptians in this and don't circumcise their children.
105. The Colchians and Egyptians have something in common: they are the only two cultures that work linen, and they have a unique way of doing it. They also share similar lifestyles and languages. Linen has two names: the Colchian kind is called "Sardonian" by the Greeks, and the Egyptian kind is called "Egyptian".
106. Sesostris, the king of Egypt, erected pillars in many countries, but most of them are no longer visible. I saw them in Palestine, Syria, with inscriptions and images of women's genitalia. Additionally, there are two statues of him carved into rock in Ionia, one on the road from Ephesus to Phocaea and the other on the road from Sardis to Smyrna. Both statues are over twenty feet tall, with a spear in his right hand and a bow in his left, and the rest of his equipment is proportionate. Across his chest, from one shoulder to the other, is an inscription in Egyptian sacred characters that reads, "I won this land with the strength of my shoulders." There is no indication of who he is or where he comes from, but it is revealed elsewhere. Some people think these statues are of Memnon, but they are wrong.
107. When Sesostris, an Egyptian ruler, and his sons were travelling home from subjugating many lands, his brother invited them to a banquet and then set the house on fire. Sesostris, aware of the situation, consulted his wife who was with him and she advised him to lay two of his six sons on the fire to make a bridge so they could escape. Sesostris followed her advice and two of his sons were burned, but the rest of them escaped alive with their father.
108. After returning to Egypt and exacting revenge on his brother, Sesostris found work for the multitude he had brought with him from the countries he had conquered. These people were the ones who dragged the large, long blocks of stone to the temple of Hephaestus during his reign, and they were also the ones who had to dig all the canals that now crisscross Egypt, making it so that horses and carts were no longer necessary. The reason why the king divided the country this way was because those Egyptians who lived in towns not on the Nile, but inland, would be left without water when the flood receded, and they would only have access to brackish water from wells.
109. Egypt was divided by the king, who gave each Egyptian an equal parcel of land and collected a yearly tax from them. If someone was robbed of part of their land by the river, they could go to Sesostris and report it, and the king would send people to investigate and calculate the amount of land lost, so that the tax could be adjusted accordingly. I believe this is where the Greeks learned the art of measuring land, and the sunclock, sundial, and twelve divisions of the day came to Hellas from Babylonia, not Egypt.
110. Sesostris was the only Egyptian king to also rule Ethiopia, and to commemorate his name, he placed two fifty-foot-tall statues of himself and his wife in front of the temple of Hephaestus, as well as four thirty-three-foot-tall statues of his sons. Later, Darius the Persian wanted to put his own statue in front of these, but the priest of Hephaestus refused, saying that Darius had not achieved anything close to what Sesostris had done, as Sesostris had conquered the Scythians and many other nations that Darius had not been able to defeat. The priest said it was not fair for Darius to put his statue before Sesostris', whose accomplishments he had not matched. Darius eventually conceded to the priest's wishes.
111. When Sesostris died, his son Pheros48 took the throne. He never waged war, but he did become blind due to a daring act. The Nile had risen to an unprecedented thirty feet, and the wind was whipping up the water. Pheros, so bold, grabbed a spear and threw it into the river. Immediately after, he was struck with a disease of the eyes and was blind for ten years. An oracle from Buto told him that his punishment would end if he washed his eyes with the urine of a woman who had only been with her husband. He tried his own wife first, but when that didn't work, he tried all the women in succession. Finally, the one who cured him, he married. To commemorate his deliverance from blindness, he dedicated two obelisks to the temple of the Sun. Each was made of a single block and was over one hundred and sixty-six feet high and thirteen feet thick. He also gathered all the women he had tried, except the one who had cured him, and burned them and the town they were in, now known as Red Clay.
112. Pheros was succeeded, so they said, by a man from Memphis called Proteus in the Greek tongue. He had a beautiful and well-equipped temple precinct at Memphis, south of the temple of Hephaestus. Phoenicians from Tyre lived around the precinct, and the whole area was known as the Camp of the Tyrians. Inside the precinct of Proteus was a temple called the temple of the Foreign Aphrodite, which I believe was a temple of Helen, daughter of Tyndarus. This is because I heard the story of Helen's stay with Proteus, and also because it was named after the Foreign Aphrodite, which is a name not given to any other of Aphrodite's temples.
113. I asked the priests and they told me the story of Helen. Alexandrus had taken her from Sparta and was sailing away when strong winds blew him into the Egyptian Sea. He ended up at the Canopic mouth of the Nile and the Salters'. There was (and still is) a temple of Heracles on the coast, where a servant of any man could take refuge and be branded with sacred marks, delivering himself to the god, and no one could touch him. This law has been the same since the beginning. When Alexandrus' servants heard of the temple law, they ran away from him, threw themselves on the mercy of the god, and accused Alexandrus of wronging Menelaus, telling the whole story of Helen. They presented this accusation to the priests and the warden of the Nile mouth, Thonis.
114. When Thonis heard the news, he sent a message to Proteus at Memphis as quickly as possible: "A stranger has arrived, a Trojan, who has committed a terrible crime in Greece. He has come here with his guest-friend's wife and a lot of wealth, brought here by the wind. Should we let him sail away unscathed, or should we take away what he has brought with him?" Proteus replied: "Whoever this is who has acted so wickedly against his guest-friend, seize him and bring him to me so I can hear what he has to say."
115. Upon hearing this, Thonis seized Alexandrus and detained his ships in Memphis. He brought Alexandrus, Helen, all the wealth, and the suppliants with him. When they had all arrived, Proteus asked Alexandrus who he was and where he had come from. Alexandrus told him his lineage, the name of his country, and the details of his voyage. Proteus then asked him where he had gotten Helen, but when Alexandrus was evasive and did not tell the truth, the men who had taken refuge with the temple refuted him and told the whole story of the wrong. Proteus declared his judgment, saying, "I never kill strangers who have been caught by the wind and driven to my coasts, so I won't punish you on behalf of the Greek, but you are a most vile man for committing the gravest impiety after having your guest-friend's hospitality. You had your guest-friend's wife and then you got her to fly with you and took her away, along with your guest-friend's wealth. I will not let you take away this woman and the wealth, but I will watch them for the Greek stranger until he comes and takes them away. I warn you and your sailors to leave my country for another within three days, or else I will declare war on you."
116. The priests said Helen came to Proteus, and I believe Homer knew this story too, but he chose not to use it in his epic poetry. This is evident in the Iliad, where he talks about Alexander's journey and how he and Helen were taken off course and ended up in Sidon, Phoenicia. He also mentions it in the Odyssey, saying Helen had drugs from Thon's wife, Polydamna, an Egyptian. Menelaus also tells Telemachus he was held in Egypt because he hadn't sacrificed enough hecatombs to the gods. These verses prove that the Cyprian poems were not written by Homer, as they say Alexander and Helen reached Ilion in three days from Sparta, whereas the Iliad shows they were taken off course.
117. Once I asked the priests if the Greek story of Troy was true, and they told me they had asked Menelaus himself. After Helen was taken, a large group of Greeks arrived in Troy on Menelaus' behalf and sent messengers, including Menelaus, to Ilion. When they were let inside the city walls, they asked for Helen and the property that Alexandrus had stolen from Menelaus to be returned, and for reparations for the wrongs. The Trojans said they didn't have Helen or the property, and that it was in Egypt with Proteus the Egyptian, so they couldn't make reparations. The Greeks thought the Trojans were making fun of them, so they laid siege to the city until they took it, but Helen wasn't there. They heard the same story as before, so they sent Menelaus to Proteus to get the truth.
118. Menelaus journeyed to Egypt and up the river to Memphis, where he told the truth of the matter and was welcomed with great hospitality. He was able to reclaim Helen, who had not been harmed, and all his wealth. However, Menelaus was guilty of injustice towards the Egyptians when he was delayed by bad weather and sacrificed two native children. When this became known, he fled with his ships to Libya, hated and hunted, and the Egyptians could not say where he went from there. The priests said they had learned some of this through inquiry, but were certain of what had happened in their own country.
119. I believe the priests of Egypt when they spoke of Helen, for it stands to reason that had she been in Troy, the Greeks would have been given her back, willingly or not. It's hard to imagine Priam or those closest to him being so foolish as to risk their lives, their children, and their city, just so Alexander could be with Helen. Even if they were so inclined in the beginning, when the Trojans were losing many of their own in battle and Priam had lost two or three of his sons (if the poets are to be believed), I can't help but think he would have given her back to the Greeks if it meant escaping the evils that had befallen them. Alexander was not even the heir to the throne, so it would have been up to Hector, who was older and better than Alexander, to make the decision. But since they didn't have Helen to give back and the Greeks wouldn't believe them, even though they spoke the truth, I'm convinced that the gods made it so the Trojans would be destroyed, to show that retribution for terrible wrongdoings is also terrible. That's what I think.
120. After Proteus, Rhampsinitus was the next to reign, and he left his name memorialized in the western forecourt of the temple of Hephaestus, where he set two statues forty-one feet high. The Egyptians called the northernmost statue Summer and the southernmost Winter, and they worshipped and treated Summer well, but not Winter. Rhampsinitus had so much silver wealth that none of the succeeding kings could surpass or come near it, so he had a stone chamber built with one wall abutting the outer side of his palace. The builder shrewdly provided that one stone could be easily removed by two men or even one, and when the chamber was finished, the king stored his treasure in it. Before the builder died, he summoned his two sons and told them how he had provided for them, explaining clearly how to remove the stone and giving them the coordinates of it. His sons got to work at once, coming to the palace by night and managing to remove the stone and take away much of the treasure. When the king opened the building and saw the containers lacking their treasure, he had traps made and placed around the containers. The thieves came again, and one of them was caught in the trap. He called to his brother to come in quickly and cut off his head, and his brother did as he was persuaded, replacing the stone and going home with his brother's head. When the king saw the thief's body without a head, he suspended it from the wall and set guards over it, instructing them to seize and bring to him anyone they saw weeping or making lamentation. The thief's mother was terribly stricken and threatened to go to the king and denounce her surviving son if he did not obey her. He devised a plan and harnessed asses with skins full of wine, and when he was near the guards, he pulled at the feet of two or three of the skins and loosed their fastenings, and the guards ran out into the road with cups and caught what was pouring out. Feigning anger, the man cursed all, but when the guards addressed him peaceably, he pretended to be soothed and gave them one of the skins. They lay down there just as they were, disposed to drink, and included him and told him to stay and drink with them, and he consented and stayed. When they cheerily saluted him in their drinking, he gave them yet another of the skins, and the guards grew very drunk and lay down, overpowered by sleep. He cut down the body of his brother and shaved the right cheek of each of the guards for the indignity, and loading the body on his asses, drove home, fulfilling his mother's commands. When the king learned that the body of the thief had been taken, he put his own daughter in a brothel, instructing her to accept all alike and, before having intercourse, to make each tell her the shrewdest and most impious thing he had done in his life. The thief cut the arm off a fresh corpse at the shoulder and went to the king's daughter, carrying it under his cloak, and when asked the same question as the rest, he said that his most impious act had been when he had cut the head off his brother who was caught in a trap in the king's treasury. When she heard this, the princess grabbed for him, but in the darkness the thief let her have the arm of the corpse and was gone in a flash out the door. When this also came to the king's ears, he was astonished at the man's ingenuity and daring, and he sent a proclamation to every town, promising the thief immunity and a great reward if he would come into the king's presence. The thief trusted the king and came before him, and Rhampsinitus was very admiring and gave him his daughter to marry on the grounds that he was the cleverest of men.
121. They said that later, King Rhampsinitus went down to what the Greeks call Hades and played dice with Demeter. After winning some and losing some, he returned with a gift from her - a golden hand towel. To this day, the Egyptians celebrate a festival in honor of his descent, though it is unclear if this is why they celebrate. On the day of the festival, the priests weave a cloth and bind it as a headband on the eyes of one of their number, who is then guided by two wolves to Demeter's temple, three miles away from the city. The priests go back, but the priest with his eyes bandaged is guided back to the same place by the wolves.
122. Believing in such tales, I record what I have heard from all sources. The Egyptians say that Demeter and Dionysus are the rulers of the underworld. They were also the first to believe that the human soul is immortal and, upon death, enters into another living thing, going through all creatures of land, sea, and air, before entering a human body at birth, completing the cycle in three thousand years. Some Greeks have adopted this doctrine, some earlier and some later, but I know their names but choose not to record them.
123. King Rhampsinitus had been a great ruler, and Egypt had prospered under his rule, but his successor, Kheops, brought the people to utter misery. He closed all the temples, forcing the Egyptians to work for him. He assigned some to drag stones from the Arabian mountains to the Nile, and then across the river to the Libyan mountains. A hundred thousand men worked in gangs for three months at a time, building a road over which the stones were dragged. This road was nearly a mile long, twenty yards wide, and sixteen yards high, and was made of polished stone carved with figures. The ten years of labor also went to building underground chambers in the hill where the pyramids stand, which Kheops intended to be his burial places. He surrounded them with water, bringing in a channel from the Nile. The pyramid itself took twenty years to build, with a base of eight hundred feet on each side and a height of the same. It was made of polished stone, with no block less than thirty feet in length.
124. The pyramid was built like stairs, which some called steps and others tiers. When the first form was completed, the workmen used short wooden logs as levers to lift the stones from the ground onto the first tier. Once the stone was raised, it was set on another lever on the first tier and the lever was used to lift it to the next tier. It is uncertain whether there was a new lever on each tier or just one portable lever that was carried up to each tier, as both possibilities were mentioned. What is certain is that the upper part of the pyramid was finished first, then the next below it, and lastly the base and the lowest part. There are writings on the pyramid in Egyptian characters indicating how much was spent on radishes, onions, and garlic for the workmen; the interpreter said that sixteen hundred talents of silver had been paid. This suggests that a great amount must have been spent on the iron with which they worked, and the workmen's food and clothing, considering the time spent building, hewing, carrying the stone, and digging out the underground parts, which was likely a long process.
125. Kheops was so wicked that, needing money, he forced his own daughter to work in a brothel and charge a fee (though the amount was not specified). She did as her father commanded, but wanted to leave a memorial of her own, so she asked each customer to give her a stone. It is said that these stones were used to build the pyramid that stands between the two great pyramids, each side measuring 150 feet.
126. The Egyptians said that Kheops reigned for fifty years and was succeeded by his brother Khephren, who was just like him. Khephren built a smaller pyramid than his brother's, which I have measured myself. It has no underground chambers and is not entered by a canal from the Nile like the other, but the river comes in through a built passage and encircles an island where, they say, Kheops himself lies. This pyramid is built on the same scale as the other, except it is forty feet shorter in height. Both of them stand on the same ridge which is about a hundred feet high. According to the Egyptians, Khephren reigned for fifty-six years.
127. For a hundred and six years, Egypt was in great misery and the temples were never opened. The people hate the memory of the two kings so much that they don't even want to name them, and instead call the pyramids after the shepherd Philitis, who was pasturing his flocks in the area at the time.
128. Mycerinus, the son of Kheops, was the next king of Egypt. He disliked his father's actions and opened the temples, allowing the people, who had been ground down to the depths of misery, to go back to their business and sacrifices. He was renowned for being the most just judge among all the kings. Not only were his judgments fair, but he would also give a present from his own estate to anyone who was not satisfied with the judgment. Despite his mildness towards his people and his conduct, he suffered a great tragedy when his only daughter died. Grief-stricken, he wanted to give her a more sumptuous burial than usual, so he made a hollow cow's image of gilded wood and placed her body inside.
129. At the time of my visit to Saïs, there was a cow in the palace, not buried in the earth, but standing in a furnished room. Every day, incense of all kinds was offered before it, and a lamp burned beside it all night. In another chamber, there were twenty colossal wooden figures of naked women, said to be Mycerinus' concubines, though I cannot confirm this.
130. Mycerinus had a passion for his own daughter, and they say he forced himself on her. She was so grief-stricken that she strangled herself, and he buried her in a cow. Her mother, in a fit of rage, cut off the hands of the attendants who had betrayed the daughter to her father. Now, their statues are missing their hands, which is why I think this is a silly story. When I visited, the hands had already fallen off due to age, and were lying at their feet.
131. The cow is draped in a purple robe, with only its head and neck exposed, encrusted with a thick layer of gold. Between its horns is a golden figure of the sun's orb. It is as big as a large live cow, but it kneels instead of standing. Every year, when the Egyptians mourn the god whose name shall not be spoken, the cow is brought out into the light. It is said that before she died, she asked her father Mycerinus to let her see the sun once a year.
132. After his daughter's tragedy, the king received an oracle from Buto that he had only six years to live and would die in the seventh. The king was outraged and sent a message of reproach to the oracle, blaming the gods that his father and uncle, who had disregarded the gods and destroyed men, had lived for a long time, but he who was pious was going to die so soon. A second oracle came, announcing that his life was ending because he had done something contrary to fate; Egypt should have been afflicted for a hundred and fifty years, but the two kings before him knew this, but not him. Upon hearing this, Mycerinus knew his fate was sealed. To prove the oracle wrong, he had many lamps made and lit them at nightfall, drinking and enjoying himself, not stopping day or night, roaming to the marsh country, groves, and other places of pleasure. He tried to turn night into day, hoping to make his six years into twelve.
133. Mycerinus and Amasis, two kings, both left pyramids behind. Mycerinus' was much larger, with each side measuring three hundred feet long and half its height made of Ethiopian stone. Some Greeks claim that Rhodopis, a courtesan, built it, but this is wrong; they must not have known who she was, or that she lived during Amasis' reign, not Mycerinus', since she was born a Thracian slave of Iadmon, son of Hephaestopolis the Samian, and a fellow-slave of Aesop the story-writer. This was made clear when the Delphians, following an oracle, offered compensation for Aesop's death, and only Iadmon's son accepted it, proving that Aesop was also owned by Iadmon.
134. Xanthes of Samos brought Rhodopis to Egypt to work, but Kharaxus of Mytilene, son of Scamandronymus and brother of the poetess Sappho, freed her for a lot of money. Rhodopis lived as a free woman in Egypt, where her allure earned her a great deal of money - enough for her, but not enough to build a pyramid. To this day, one can calculate what one tenth of her worth was, so she was not incredibly wealthy. Rhodopis wanted to leave a memorial of herself in Greece, so she spent one tenth of her wealth on a great number of iron beef spits, which she sent to Delphi and which still lie in a heap behind the altar set up by the Chians and in front of the shrine itself. Her fame spread throughout Greece, and she became so well-known that a certain Archidice was the theme of song, though not as celebrated as Rhodopis. After freeing Rhodopis, Kharaxus returned to Mytilene, and Sappho attacked him in one of her poems.
135. After Mycerinus, the priests said Asukhis became king of Egypt and built the eastern outer court of Hephaestus' temple, which was the grandest of all the courts due to its carved figures and numerous architectural features. They also told me that, since there was not much money in circulation during his reign, a law was made allowing a person to borrow on the security of their father's corpse. The law also stated that the lender would become the master of the borrower's burial-vault and that the penalty for failing to repay the loan was that the borrower would not be allowed to be buried in their father's tomb or any other, nor could they bury any relatives there. Furthermore, Asukhis wanted to outdo all the other kings of Egypt, so he left a pyramid of brick with an inscription on a stone that read: “Do not think me less than pyramids of stone; for I excel them as much as Zeus does other gods; for they stuck a pole down into a marsh and collected what mud clung to the pole, made bricks of it, and thus built me.” These were the acts of Asukhis.
136. Anysis, a blind man from the town of the same name, reigned after him. During his reign, Egypt was invaded by Sabacos, king of Ethiopia, and a great army of Ethiopians. Anysis fled to the marshes, and the Ethiopian ruled Egypt for fifty years. He was known for never putting any Egyptian wrongdoer to death, but instead sentencing them to raise embankments in their native towns. This caused the towns to stand even higher than before, as they had already been built on embankments made by the canal excavators in the reign of Sesostris. Of all the towns in Egypt, Bubastis was especially prominent, with a temple of Bubastis that was most pleasing to the eye, even though other temples were greater and more costly. In Greek, Bubastis is Artemis.
137. The temple stands on an island, with two channels of the Nile running up to the entrance, each one a hundred feet wide and lined with trees. The outer court is sixty feet high, decorated with statues of ten feet in height. The city is built up around the temple, so that it can be seen down into from above. A stone wall, carved with figures, encircles the grove of tall trees surrounding the great shrine where the goddess's image is kept. The temple is a square, each side measuring an eighth of a mile. A road, paved with stone, about three eighths of a mile long and four hundred feet wide, leads eastward through the marketplace to the temple of Hermes, lined with trees reaching to the sky. This is the temple.
138. The Ethiopian's departure, they said, happened like this: after he had a dream in which someone stood over him and urged him to gather all the priests in Egypt and cut them in half, he fled the country. He believed this vision to be a sign from the gods, warning him that if he committed sacrilege he would be punished by gods or men. He refused to do so, as the time allotted for his rule over Egypt had been fulfilled. Before he had left Ethiopia, the oracles had told him he would reign for fifty years in Egypt, and now that this time had passed and he was troubled by his dream, Sabacos left Egypt of his own accord.
139. When the Ethiopian left Egypt, it is said that a blind man became king once more. He had been living in the marshes for fifty years on an island he had built out of ashes and earth. The Egyptians who were bringing him food without the Ethiopian's knowledge were instructed by the king to bring ashes with their gift, to add to the island. This island, Elbo, was never discovered until the time of Amyrtaeus, and all the kings before him had searched for it in vain for more than seven hundred years. It was over a mile long and of an equal breadth.
140. The next king of Egypt was Sethos, the priest of Hephaestus. He had no respect for the warrior Egyptians, and to make matters worse, he took away the twelve fields that had been given to each man during the reign of the former kings. When Sanacharib came to Egypt with a great force of Arabians and Assyrians, the warrior Egyptians refused to fight, leaving Sethos in a quandary. He went to the temple shrine and wept before the god's image, and while he was lamenting, he fell asleep and had a vision in which the god told him not to worry, that he would be safe from the power of Arabia and that he would be sent champions. Sethos trusted the vision and camped at Pelusium with the Egyptians who followed him, which were only merchants, craftsmen, and traders. During the night, a horde of field mice attacked their enemies, destroying their weapons and killing many of them. To this day, there is a stone statue of the Egyptian king in Hephaestus' temple, with a mouse in his hand and an inscription that reads: "Look at me, and believe."
141. The Egyptians and their priests told me that from the first king to the last priest of Hephaestus, there had been 341 generations, and the same number of kings and high priests. This adds up to 10,000 years, with an additional 1,340 years for the remaining 41 generations. In total, this period was 11,340 years, and during this time there had been no king who was a god in human form. They also said that four times during this period, the sun had risen contrary to experience - twice rising where it now sets, and twice setting where it now rises - but Egypt had not experienced any changes in the river, land, sickness, or death.
142. Hecataeus the historian once visited Thebes and created a genealogy for himself that claimed he was descended from a god in the sixteenth generation. The priests of Zeus, however, were not convinced and brought him into the great inner court of the temple. There, they showed him wooden figures of each high priest who had set up a statue of himself during his lifetime, and counted them to the total they had already given. Pointing to the figures and counting, the priests showed Hecataeus that each succeeded his father, going all the way back to the earliest figure of the man who had most recently died. Despite Hecataeus' claim that his sixteenth forefather was a god, the priests traced a line of descent through the whole line of three hundred and forty-five figures, not connecting it with any ancestral god or hero, but declaring each figure to be a "Piromis" - in Greek, one who is in all respects a good man.
143. They demonstrated that all those whose statues stood there had been good people, but not gods. They said that before these people, the rulers of Egypt were gods, but none of them had been alive at the same time as the human priests. One god or another had been in charge in succession; the last of them to rule the country was Horus, whom the Greeks call Apollo. He overthrew Typhon and was the last divine king of Egypt. Osiris is known as Dionysus in the Greek language.
144. Heracles, Dionysus, and Pan are considered the youngest gods among the Greeks, but in Egypt, Pan is the oldest of the three and one of the eight earliest gods. Heracles belongs to the second dynasty of the so-called twelve gods, and Dionysus to the third. The Egyptians have calculated and documented the years between Heracles and the reign of Amasis, and it is said that Pan is even older. The years between Dionysus and Amasis are the fewest, estimated at fifteen thousand. The Dionysus known as the son of Semele, daughter of Cadmus, lived around sixteen hundred years before the time of the author, Heracles son of Alcmene around nine hundred years, and Pan son of Penelope (according to the Greeks, Penelope and Hermes were his parents) around eight hundred years before the author, making him younger than the Trojan War.
145. When it comes to Pan and Dionysus, you can believe whatever story you find most credible, but I'm giving my opinion here. If Dionysus, son of Semele, and Pan, son of Penelope, had lived in Hellas until old age like Heracles, son of Amphitryon, it could be said that they were just men named after the older gods of antiquity. But instead, the Greek story has it that Zeus sewed Dionysus up in his thigh and took him away to Nysa in Ethiopia beyond Egypt. As for Pan, the Greeks don't know what happened to him after his birth. It's clear to me that the Greeks learned the names of these two gods later than the names of all the others, and that their births were associated with the time when they gained the knowledge.
146. So far I've reported what the Egyptians have said, but now I'll tell you what both Egyptians and foreigners have recorded, as well as something I've seen myself.
147. After the priest of Hephaestus' reign, the Egyptians were liberated. But they couldn't live without a king, so they divided Egypt into twelve districts and appointed twelve kings. These kings intermarried and promised to be close friends, never trying to overthrow one another or gain more power than the others. The reason for this agreement, which they kept faithfully, was that once they were settled in their districts, an oracle was given to them that whoever poured a libation from a bronze vessel in the temple of Hephaestus (where they used to gather in all the temples) would be the king of all Egypt.
148. They wanted to commemorate their names, so they built a labyrinth near Lake Moeris and the City of Crocodiles. I have seen it myself and it is indescribable; if you combined all the structures built by the Greeks, it would not compare to the labor and cost of this labyrinth. Even the pyramids, which are remarkable in their own right, cannot compare to this maze. It has twelve courts with doors facing each other, six north and six south, and two continuous lines within one outer wall. There are also three thousand chambers, fifteen hundred above and fifteen hundred below ground. We saw the ones above ground, but we heard about the underground chambers from the Egyptian caretakers, who said they were the burial vaults of the kings who built the labyrinth and of the sacred crocodiles. The upper chambers were incredible, with exits and passages leading to more chambers and courts. The roof was made of stone, like the walls, and the walls were covered with cut figures. At the corner where the labyrinth ends, there is a two hundred and forty foot high pyramid with great figures cut into it, and there is an underground passage to it.
149. The labyrinth of Lake Moeris is a marvel, with a circumference of four hundred and fifty miles, or sixty schoeni, stretching from north to south. It has been dug out and made by human hands, and in the middle of it stand two pyramids, each with fifty fathoms below and fifty above the water, topped with a colossal stone figure seated on a throne. These pyramids are a hundred fathoms high, which is equal to a furlong of six hundred feet, with a fathom measuring six feet or four cubits, a foot four spans, and a cubit six spans. The water of the lake is not natural, as the area is very dry, but is brought by a channel from the Nile, flowing into the lake for six months and out of it for the other six. During the six months it flows out of the lake, the daily take of fish brings a silver talent into the royal treasury, and twenty minae for each day of the flow into the lake.
150. The natives told me that this lake drained underground into the Libyan Syrtis and extended under the mountains above Memphis, with the inland country to its west. I was curious as to where the earth taken from the digging of the lake had gone, so I asked those living nearby. They told me it had been taken to the Nile, just as the thieves who plotted to steal the wealth of Sardanapallus, king of Ninus, had done when they dug an underground passage from their house to the palace. They had taken the earth from the passage and thrown it into the Tigris, which ran past Ninus, and the Egyptians had done the same with the lake, except they had done it during the day instead of at night. Thus, the lake was said to have been dug.
151. The twelve kings were just and they all came to sacrifice in Hephaestus' temple. On the last day of the feast, as they were about to pour libations, the high priest brought out the golden vessels, but he had only eleven for the twelve. Psammetichus, the last in line, had no vessel, so he took off his bronze helmet and held it out to pour the libation. All the kings were wearing helmets, so it was not done in guile. The other kings noticed what Psammetichus had done and remembered the oracle that promised the sovereignty of all Egypt to whoever poured a libation from a vessel of bronze. Though they found that Psammetichus had acted without intent, they decided to strip him of most of his power and chase him away into the marshes, forbidding him to concern himself with the rest of Egypt.
152. Psammetichus had been exiled in Syria, fleeing from Sabacos the Ethiopian who killed his father Necos. When Sabacos left due to a dream, the Egyptians of Saïs brought Psammetichus back. But then, the eleven kings drove him away again, this time into the marshes, because of a helmet. Believing he had been wronged, Psammetichus sought revenge and consulted the oracle in Buto, which told him he would have vengeance when he saw men of bronze coming from the sea. Psammetichus didn't believe it, but soon enough, Ionians and Carians, who were sailing for plunder, were forced to land on the coast of Egypt in their bronze armor. An Egyptian came to the marsh country and told Psammetichus, who had never seen armored men before, that men of bronze had come from the sea and were foraging in the plain. Psammetichus realized the oracle had been fulfilled and made friends with the Ionians and Carians, promising them great rewards if they joined him. With their help, and the help of the Egyptians who volunteered, he deposed the eleven kings.
153. After gaining control of all of Egypt, he constructed the southern outer court of Hephaestus' temple at Memphis, and built a court for Apis opposite it. This court was surrounded by a colonnade and decorated with many sculptures. The roof was supported by statues that were twenty feet tall. Apis, known as Epaphus in Greek, was kept and fed here whenever he appeared.
154. Psammetichus rewarded the Ionians and Carians who had helped him by giving them places to live in called The Camps, situated on either side of the Nile, and he paid them all that he had promised. He also put Egyptian boys in their hands to be taught Greek, and these boys eventually became the present-day Egyptian interpreters. The Ionians and Carians lived for a long time near the sea, on the arm of the Nile called the Pelusian, a little way below the town of Bubastis. Later, King Amasis removed them and settled them at Memphis to be his guard against the Egyptians. This is how we Greeks have exact knowledge of the history of Egypt from the reign of Psammetichus onwards, as a result of our communication with these settlers in Egypt, the first of foreign speech to settle in that country. In my day, there were still winches for their ships and the ruins of their houses in the places from which the Ionians and Carians were removed, and this is how Psammetichus got Egypt.
155. I've often spoken of the Egyptian oracle, and it deserves a proper account. It's sacred to Leto and located in a great city on the Sebennytic arm of the Nile, on the way up from the sea. That city is called Buto, which I've already mentioned. In Buto there's a temple of Apollo and Artemis, and the shrine of Leto where the oracle is located is huge. Its outer court is sixty feet high, but what really amazed me was the shrine itself. Its walls are made of a single stone slab, each seventy feet high and long, and the roof is made of another slab with a seven-foot-wide cornice.
156. Thus, the shrine was the most remarkable thing I saw in the temple at Buto, but the most wondrous of the second-rank things was the island of Khemmis. It lay in a deep and wide lake near the temple and the Egyptians said it floated, though I never saw it move. I thought it a remarkable tale that an island could truly float. On the island was a great shrine of Apollo with three altars, and many palm and other trees, some bearing fruit and some not. The Egyptians explain the island's movement by saying that when Typhon came hunting for the son of Osiris, Leto, one of the first gods, took charge of Apollo and hid him on the island for safety, which is now said to float. Apollo and Artemis were children of Dionysus and Isis, and Leto was their nurse and preserver. Aeschylus, son of Euphorion, was the first to suggest that Artemis was the daughter of Demeter, and this is why the island was made to float, according to the Egyptians.
157. Psammetichus ruled Egypt for 53 years, 29 of which he spent besieging Azotus, a great city in Syria, until he finally took it. Azotus was the longest-standing city against a siege that we know of.
158. Necos, the son of Psammetichus, became king of Egypt and began building a canal into the Red Sea, which was eventually finished by Darius the Persian. This canal was four days' voyage in length and wide enough for two triremes to move side by side. It was fed by the Nile and ran from a little above Bubastis to the Arabian town of Patumus, then into the Red Sea. The digging began in the Egyptian plain closest to Arabia, and the canal followed the foothills of the mountains near Memphis, where the stone quarries are, in a long stretch from west to east, then southward out of the hill country towards the Arabian Gulf. The shortest and most direct route from the northern to the southern or Red Sea is from the Casian promontory, the boundary between Egypt and Syria, to the Arabian Gulf, which is 125 miles, but the canal was far longer due to its winding path. During Necos' reign, 120,000 Egyptians died digging it, and he stopped work after a prophetic utterance that he was toiling beforehand for the "barbarian" - a term the Egyptians used for anyone who spoke a different language.
159. Necos stopped work on the canal and began preparing for war, building ships of war in the northern sea and the Arabian Gulf by the Red Sea coast - the winches for landing these ships can still be seen. He used these ships when needed and, with his land army, defeated the Syrians at Magdolus, taking the great Syrian city of Cadytis afterwards. He sent the garments he wore during these victories to Branchidae of Miletus and dedicated them to Apollo. After a sixteen-year reign, Necos died and his son Psammis took his place.
160. When Psammis was king of Egypt, ambassadors from Elis, the Eleans, visited him, boasting that they had arranged the Olympic games with justice and fairness, and claiming that even the Egyptians, the wisest of all men, could not do better. Psammis assembled the Egyptians reputed to be wisest and they learned all that the Eleans were to do regarding the games. The Eleans asked if the Egyptians could discover any juster way. The Egyptians asked if their own citizens took part in the contests and the Eleans answered that all Greeks from Elis or elsewhere could contend. The Egyptians said that this rule fell short of complete fairness and suggested that only strangers should be admitted to the contest, not Eleans, in order to make just rules.
161. Psammis reigned over Egypt for only six years before he invaded Ethiopia and died, leaving his son Apries to take his place. Apries was more fortunate than any other king before him (except his great-grandfather Psammetichus) during his twenty-five year rule, during which he sent an army against Sidon and fought at sea with the king of Tyre. But his luck ran out when he sent a great force against Cyrene and suffered a great defeat. The Egyptians blamed him for this and revolted, believing he had knowingly sent his men to their deaths so he could be more secure in his rule. Furious, those who returned home and the friends of the slain openly rebelled.
162. When Apries heard of the Egyptians' rebellion, he sent Amasis to try and dissuade them. But when Amasis arrived, an Egyptian placed a helmet on his head, signifying his new role as king. Amasis accepted the gesture and prepared to march against Apries. Apries then sent Patarbemis, one of his court, to take Amasis alive and bring him back. When Patarbemis summoned Amasis, he responded by farting and telling the messenger to take that back to Apries. Patarbemis persisted, and Amasis said he was ready to present himself to Apries. Patarbemis quickly returned to Apries and reported what was happening, but Apries, in his rage, had Patarbemis' ears and nose cut off. This outraged the other Egyptians, who had been Apries' friends, and they quickly changed sides and offered themselves to Amasis.
163. When Apries heard of this, he armed his guard and marched against the Egyptians with a bodyguard of thirty thousand Carians and Ionians. His royal palace was in the city of Saïs, a grand and remarkable palace. Apries' men and Amasis' men both marched to Momemphis, ready to face each other in battle.
164. The Egyptians are divided into seven classes: priests, warriors, cowherds, swineherds, merchants, interpreters, and pilots, each named after its occupation. The warriors are further divided into Kalasiries and Hermotubies, and all divisions in Egypt are made according to districts.
165. The Hermotubies hailed from Busiris, Saïs, Khemmis, Papremis, Prosopitis Island, and half of Natho. At their peak, their population numbered 160,000. They had no knowledge of any trade other than warfare, and were free to pursue it exclusively.
166. The Kalasiries hailed from Thebes, Bubastis, Aphthis, Tanis, Mendes, Sebennys, Athribis, Pharbaïthis, Thmuis, Onuphis, Anytis, and Myecphoris (which is located on an island near Bubastis). At their peak, they numbered up to 250,000 men, all of whom were dedicated to the hereditary calling of war and could not practice any other trade.
167. I'm not sure if the Greeks learned this from the Egyptians, but I do know that in Thrace, Scythia, Persia, Lydia, and many other countries, those who learn trades are not as highly esteemed as the rest of the population. Those who are free to practice the art of war are especially honored. It's clear that this opinion, which is held by all Greeks and especially the Lacedaemonians, is of foreign origin. The only exception is in Corinth, where artisans are held in the least contempt.
168. The warriors were the only Egyptians, apart from the priests, who had special privileges: each of them was given an untaxed plot of land measuring twelve acres, which is a square of a hundred Egyptian cubits each way (the Egyptian cubit being equal to the Samian). These lands were set aside for all warriors, and it was never the same men who cultivated them, but each in turn. The king's annual bodyguard consisted of a thousand Kalasiries and as many Hermotubies, who, in addition to their lands, each received a daily provision of five minae's weight of roasted grain, two minae of beef, and four cups of wine. These were the gifts received by each bodyguard.
169. When Apries and his guards faced off against Amasis and the whole Egyptian force at Momemphis, Apries was outnumbered and defeated. He had thought no god could depose him from his throne, yet here he was, taken captive and brought to Saïs, to the royal dwelling that had once been his but now belonged to Amasis. Amasis kept Apries alive in the palace and treated him well, but the Egyptians complained that it was unjust to keep their king's bitterest enemy alive, so Amasis gave Apries up to them and they strangled him and buried him in the burial-place of his fathers, in the temple of Athena near the sanctuary on the left of the entrance. The people of Saïs buried all their native kings within the temple precinct. Amasis' tomb is farther from the sanctuary than Apries' and his ancestors', but it too is within the temple court; a great colonnade of stone, richly adorned with pillars made in the form of palm trees, with two portals and the coffin within.
170. At Saïs, there is a burial place in the temple of Athena, right up against the wall of the shrine. It's a place so sacred that I dare not speak its name. There are also great stone obelisks in the precinct, and a lake nearby, with a stone border, perfectly round, about the size of the Round Pond at Delos.
171. At night on this lake, the Egyptians perform a ritual they call the Mysteries, which tells the story of the gods' suffering. I know the truth, but I'll remain discreetly silent. I'll also remain silent about the Thesmophoria, the ritual of Demeter, except for what I'm allowed to say. The daughters of Danaus brought this ritual from Egypt and taught it to the Pelasgian women. When the Dorians drove out the people of the Peloponnese, the ritual was lost, except for what was preserved by the Arcadians, the Peloponnesian people who stayed in their homeland.
172. Amasis, from the town of Siuph in the district of Saïs, became king after Apries was deposed. At first, the Egyptians scorned him for being a common man of no high family, but he won them over with his shrewdness and lack of arrogance. He had a golden washbowl among his countless treasures, which he and all those who ate with him used to clean their feet. He broke it into pieces and made a god's image out of it, which he placed in a very visible spot in the city. The Egyptians began to revere it. When Amasis found out, he called them together and said, "This image was made out of the washbowl, which you once used to vomit, urinate, and clean your feet in, but now you revere it. I have been like this washbowl - before I was a common man, but now I am your king. So honor and show respect for me."
173. He had a specific schedule: in the morning, he would attend to any business that came his way until the marketplace filled up, and then he would spend the rest of the day drinking, joking, and being idle and playful. His friends were not pleased with this, telling him, "O King, you should not be so vulgar. You are a celebrated man and should be sitting on a celebrated throne, so the Egyptians know they are governed by a great man. What you are doing is not kingly." He replied, "It's like a bow: you string it when you need to use it and unstring it when you're done. If you keep it strung all the time, it will break. The same goes for people. If you don't give yourself a break, you'll go mad or become an idiot. I know this, so I give each of the two its turn."
174. When Amasis was a private man, it was said that he was fond of drinking and joking and was not particularly sober. When his drinking and pleasure-seeking left him without the bare necessities, he resorted to stealing. When he was accused of taking someone else's possessions, he was brought to the nearest place of divination, and sometimes the oracles declared him guilty and sometimes they acquitted him. When he became king, he took special care of the gods who had declared him guilty, believing their oracles to be infallible, but he neglected the gods who had acquitted him, considering their oracles to be false and their shrines worthless.
175. Amasis built an incredible outer court for the temple of Athena at Saïs, which was taller and larger than any other. He also set up huge statues and sphinxes with human heads, and brought in enormous stone blocks for the building. Some of these blocks came from the quarries of Memphis, while the largest was from the city of Elephantine, a twenty-day journey away by river. But what really impressed me was this: he brought a shrine from Elephantine that was made of one single block of stone. It took three years and two thousand men to transport it, all of them pilots. This chamber was thirty-five feet long, twenty-three feet wide, and thirteen feet high on the outside, and thirty-one feet long, twenty feet wide, and eight feet high on the inside. It was placed at the entrance of the temple, but they say it was never dragged inside because the chief builder complained about the expense of time and his loathing of the work, and Amasis, taking this to heart, refused to let it be moved any further. Some also say that a man, one of those who was lifting the shrine, was crushed by it, so it was never taken inside.
176. Amasis dedicated monuments of remarkable size to all the other noteworthy temples, including the huge image that lies prone before the temple of Hephaestus at Memphis, which is seventy-five feet long. On either side of the great image, two statues, each twenty feet high, were carved from the same block and stand on the same base. At Saïs, there is another stone figure of the same size, also lying prone. Amasis also built the great and most impressive temple of Isis at Memphis.
177. In the reign of Amasis, Egypt was said to have reached its peak of prosperity, thanks to the river and the land providing for its people. It was reported that there were twenty thousand inhabited cities in the country. Amasis also made a law that every Egyptian had to declare their means of livelihood to the ruler of their district annually, and if they failed to do so or prove they had a legitimate livelihood, they would be punished with death. Solon the Athenian took this law from Egypt and implemented it among his people, wishing them to always have it, as it was a perfect law.
178. Amasis was a philhellene, and he provided many services to the Greeks, including giving them the city of Naucratis to live in and lands to set up altars and holy places for their gods. The most famous and visited of these was the Hellenion, founded by the Ionian cities of Chios, Teos, Phocaea, and Clazomenae, the Dorian cities of Rhodes, Cnidus, Halicarnassus, and Phaselis, and one Aeolian city, Mytilene. These cities were the rightful overseers of the trading port, and any other cities that claimed otherwise were wrong. The Aeginetans made a precinct of their own, sacred to Zeus, and the Samians did the same for Hera and the Milesians for Apollo.
179. In the past, Naucratis was the only trading port in Egypt. Anyone who arrived at any other mouth of the Nile had to swear that they had not come intentionally, and then had to take their ship and sail to the Canobic mouth. If they couldn't sail against the contrary winds, they had to transport their cargo in barges around the Delta until they reached Naucratis. This is how highly regarded Naucratis was.
180. When the Amphictyons paid three hundred talents to build the temple that now stands at Delphi (the previous one having been destroyed by accident), the Delphians were responsible for a fourth of the cost. To raise the funds, they traveled from city to city collecting donations, and received the most from Egypt; Amasis gave them a thousand talents' worth of astringent earth, and the Greek settlers in Egypt gave twenty minae.
181. Amasis made friends and allies with the people of Cyrene, and decided to marry one of them, either because he had his heart set on a Greek wife, or to strengthen the bond of friendship. He married a woman called Ladice, who some said was the daughter of Battus, others said Arcesilaus, and others Critobulus, an esteemed citizen of the place. However, whenever Amasis tried to have intercourse with her, he was unable to, though he could with every other woman. When this happened repeatedly, Amasis accused Ladice of casting a spell on him and threatened her with a terrible death if she did not remedy the problem. In desperation, Ladice prayed to Aphrodite that if Amasis could have intercourse with her that night, she would send a statue to Cyrene in her honour. Immediately after her prayer, Amasis was able to have intercourse with her, and he grew very fond of her. Ladice kept her vow and sent a statue to Cyrene, which remained there until the time of Cambyses, who, upon conquering Egypt and learning who Ladice was, sent her away to Cyrene unharmed.
182. Amasis made offerings in Hellas, gifting Cyrene with a gilt image of Athena and a painted portrait of himself, two stone images and a marvellous linen breast-plate to Athena of Lindus, and two wooden statues of himself to Hera in Samos, which were still standing behind the doors of the great shrine when I was there. He dedicated these offerings to Samos out of friendship for Polycrates, son of Aeaces, and to Lindus because the temple of Athena there was said to have been founded by the daughters of Danaus when they landed there in their escape from the sons of Egyptus. Amasis was also the first to conquer Cyprus, making it tributary to himself.
