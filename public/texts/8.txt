1. The Greeks assigned to the naval fleet were as follows: Athens provided 127 ships, with Plataeans helping to crew them, not because they knew how to sail, but due to their bravery and enthusiasm. Corinth contributed 40 ships, Megara 20, Chalcis 20 (with Athens supplying the ships), Aegina 18, Sicyon 12, Lacedaemon 10, Epidaurus 8, Eretria 7, Troezen 5, Styra 2, and Ceos 2, along with two 50-oared boats. The Opuntian Locrians also supported them with seven 50-oared boats. 
2. The forces that gathered at Artemisium for battle included a total of 271 ships, not counting the fifty-oared boats. Each group contributed a specific number of ships, as previously mentioned. The Spartans, led by Admiral Eurybiades, son of Euryclides, were in charge of the entire fleet. The allies insisted on having a Spartan leader, stating that they would rather disband the fleet than be led by the Athenians. 
3. In the beginning, before seeking an alliance with Sicily, there was a discussion about giving the Athenians control of the naval forces. However, when the allies objected, the Athenians decided not to insist on their claim. They believed that the safety of Hellas was more important and understood that if they fought over leadership, Hellas would be destroyed. They knew that internal conflict was worse than a united war, which in turn was worse than peace. So, they stepped back from their claim, but only while they still needed the support of the others. This became evident later when, after pushing back the Persians, they used Pausanias' arrogance as an excuse to take control away from the Lacedaemonians. But all of this happened later on. 
4. When the Greeks finally arrived at Artemisium, they saw a large number of ships and troops at Aphetae, and the enemy appeared much stronger than they had expected. As a result, they became discouraged and started discussing the possibility of retreating back to Hellas. The people of Euboea, noticing these plans, asked Eurybiades to wait a while so they could evacuate their families. When they couldn't convince him, they tried another approach by offering Themistocles, the Athenian admiral, a bribe of thirty talents. In exchange, the Greek fleet would stay and fight to defend Euboea when the battle took place. 
5. Themistocles managed to convince the Greeks to stay and fight by giving Eurybiades five talents of the bribe money, making it seem like a personal gift. Once Eurybiades was persuaded, most of the others agreed to stay, except for Adimantus, the Corinthian admiral, who insisted on leaving Artemisium. Themistocles then promised Adimantus an even greater gift than what the Persian king would offer for betraying their allies, and sent him three talents of silver. With these two leaders convinced, the Euboeans achieved their goal, and Themistocles benefited as well. No one knew that he had kept the rest of the money, and those who received a portion of it assumed it had been sent by the Athenians for that purpose. 
6. The Greeks decided to stay in Euboea and fight, and here's how it happened. The enemy forces arrived at Aphetae in the early afternoon and saw the small number of Greek ships near Artemisium that they had heard about. They were eager to attack and capture these ships. However, they didn't want to launch a direct attack, as they were worried that the Greeks would see them coming and escape under the cover of night. They believed that the Greeks would try to flee, and they didn't want even the smallest chance for them to get away. 
7. Considering these factors, the enemy forces came up with a plan. They separated 200 ships from their fleet and sent them on a secret route around Sciathus and Euboea, passing by Caphereus and Geraestus towards the Euripus. Their goal was to trap the Greeks between these ships and the main force, blocking their escape route while attacking them from the front. They decided not to attack the Greeks until they saw a signal from the ships that had sailed around, indicating their arrival. With this plan in place, they sent the 200 ships on their mission and began organizing the remaining forces at Aphetae. 
8. During this time, there was a man named Scyllias in the enemy fleet, who was from Scione and known as the best diver of his time. He had previously saved many valuable items for the Persians during a shipwreck at Pelion and had also gained a lot for himself. Scyllias had been planning to join the Greeks for a while, but he hadn't found the right opportunity until now. It's unclear exactly how he managed to reach the Greeks, but there's an incredible story that claims he dove into the sea at Aphetae and swam underwater for about eighty furlongs, only resurfacing when he reached Artemisium. There are many stories about Scyllias, some believable and some not, but in this case, it's more likely that he reached Artemisium by boat. Once he arrived, he immediately informed the Greek admirals about the shipwreck and the enemy ships that had been sent around Euboea. 
9. Upon hearing this information, the Greeks discussed their options. There was a lot of debate, but they ultimately decided to stay where they were for the day and then, after midnight, set sail to confront the enemy ships that were sailing around. However, as they didn't face any resistance, they changed their plan and decided to move their ships towards the enemy in the late afternoon. They wanted to test the enemy's fighting style and their ability to break through the line. 
10. When Xerxes' soldiers and generals saw the Greeks approaching with only a few ships, they believed the Greeks had gone mad. They set sail, expecting an easy victory, which seemed reasonable since their own fleet was much larger and had better ships. Confidently, they surrounded the Greeks. The Ionians who were friendly to the Greeks reluctantly joined the battle and were worried when they saw the Greeks trapped. They thought none of the Greeks would make it back home, as they appeared to be at a significant disadvantage. However, those who were happy about the situation competed with each other to be the first to capture an Athenian ship and receive rewards from the king, as the Athenians were the most talked-about in the fleet. 
11. When the signal was given, the Greeks first pulled the back of their ships together, facing the enemy with their prows. At the second signal, they began to fight, even though they were trapped in a tight space and had to battle face-to-face. In this fight, they managed to capture thirty enemy ships, as well as Philaon, the brother of Gorgus, the king of Salamis. Philaon was an important figure in the enemy fleet. An Athenian named Lycomedes, son of Aeschraeus, was the first Greek to capture an enemy ship, and he was awarded the prize for bravery. The battle was evenly matched, and it only ended when night fell. The Greeks returned to Artemisium, while the enemy forces went back to Aphetae, having performed worse than they had hoped in the fight. During the battle, Antidorus of Lemnos, the only Greek fighting for the Persians, switched sides and joined the Greeks. In gratitude, the Athenians gave him land in Salamis. 
12. As night fell during midsummer, heavy rain and loud thunder from Pelion filled the air. The dead bodies and wreckage from the battle were pushed towards Aphetae, where they got tangled with the front of the ships and messed up the oars. The sailors there were frightened by the noise and, given their current situation, feared total destruction. They had already experienced a shipwreck and storm off Pelion, followed by a tough sea battle. Now, they had to deal with pouring rain, strong torrents flowing into the sea, and intense thunder. 
13. The night was difficult for them. However, it was even worse for those who were assigned to sail around Euboea, as they were caught in the open sea. They met a terrible fate when the storm and rain hit them near the Hollows of Euboea. The wind blew them off course and forced them onto the rocks. This was all done by the gods to make sure that the Persian and Greek forces were more evenly matched, and not heavily in favor of the Persians. 
14. The men near the Hollows of Euboea perished. Meanwhile, the enemy forces at Aphetae were relieved when daylight arrived. Due to their difficult situation, they decided not to move their ships for the time being. Soon, fifty-three Athenian ships arrived to help the Greeks, boosting their morale. They were also encouraged by the news that the enemy ships sailing around Euboea had been destroyed in the recent storm. The Greeks waited for the same hour as before and attacked some Cilician ships when they set sail. After destroying these ships, they returned to Artemisium as night fell. 
15. On the third day, the enemy commanders couldn't stand the damage caused by the small Greek fleet and feared Xerxes' anger. They didn't wait for the Greeks to start the fight and set sail around noon. As a result, the sea battles took place on the same days as the land battles at Thermopylae. The sailors tried to defend the Euripus while Leonidas' men guarded the passage. The Greeks were determined to prevent the enemy from entering their land, while the Persians aimed to defeat the Greek forces and take control of the strait. 
16. When Xerxes' forces prepared for battle and advanced, the Greeks stayed near Artemisium. The enemy ships formed a half-circle, trying to surround and trap the Greeks. In response, the Greeks charged and engaged in battle. Both sides experienced equal success during the fight. Xerxes' fleet suffered due to its large size and numbers, as the ships became disorganized and collided with each other. However, they refused to retreat, not wanting to be defeated by a smaller fleet. Many Greek ships and soldiers were lost in the battle, but even more enemy ships and men perished. The fight continued until both sides eventually withdrew and separated from each other. 
17. During that sea battle, the Egyptians from Xerxes' forces fought with the most courage. They accomplished many great feats, including capturing five Greek ships along with their crews. Among the Greeks, the Athenians performed the best that day, with Clinias, son of Alcibiades, standing out among them. He contributed a ship and two hundred men to the war, all funded by himself. 
18. After the battle, both sides quickly returned to their own bases. The Greeks, having gained control of the battleground, were left with the dead and the wreckage. However, they too had faced difficulties, especially the Athenians, whose half of the ships had been damaged. As a result, they decided to retreat to the safer waters within Greece. 
19. Themistocles believed that if the Ionian and Carian nations were removed from the enemy forces, the Greeks might have a better chance of winning against the remaining opponents. The people of Euboea usually brought their livestock to the sea in that area. Themistocles gathered the admirals and shared his plan to lure away the king's strongest allies, without revealing too many details. He suggested that they should take as many animals from the Euboean herds as they wanted, as it was better for the fleet to have them than the enemy. He also advised them to light fires and promised to ensure their safe return to Greece. The admirals agreed to follow his plan, lit fires, and took the livestock. 
20. The people of Euboea had ignored Bacis' oracle, thinking it had no meaning, and they didn't take any precautions against the arrival of an enemy. This led to their own downfall, as the oracle's prophecy about this situation went like this: "When a foreign-speaking man throws a papyrus yoke on the waves, be sure to keep the bleating goats away from Euboea's shores." The Euboeans didn't pay attention to these words, and as a result, they faced great misfortune during the current and upcoming troubles. 
21. While the Greeks were busy with their tasks, a lookout from Trachis arrived with news. At Artemisium, a scout named Polyas from Anticyra was responsible for informing the men at Thermopylae if the fleet faced any setbacks, using a rowing boat prepared for this purpose. Similarly, if the land army encountered any problems, an Athenian named Abronichus, son of Lysicles, was with Leonidas, ready to deliver the news to the Greeks at Artemisium using a thirty-oared ship. So, Abronichus arrived and informed them about the fate of Leonidas and his army. Upon hearing this, the Greeks didn't waste any more time and began to leave in their designated order, with the Corinthians departing first and the Athenians last. 
22. Themistocles selected the most reliable Athenian ships and went to the locations where drinking water was available. There, he carved a message on the rocks, which the Ionians read the next day when they arrived at Artemisium. The message said: "People of Ionia, it's wrong to fight against your ancestors' land and bring slavery to Greece. It's better to join us, but if that's not possible, at least withdraw from the war and encourage the Carians to do the same. If neither option is possible and you're forced to fight, don't use your full strength in battle. Remember, you're our descendants, and this conflict with the foreigners started because of you." Themistocles likely had two intentions with this message: if King Xerxes didn't know about it, it might persuade the Ionians to switch sides and join the Greeks. However, if someone reported the message to Xerxes with ill intentions, it could make him distrust the Ionians and exclude them from sea battles. 
23. Themistocles had left this message for the Ionians. Soon after, a man from Histiaea arrived in a boat, informing the enemy forces that the Greeks had fled from Artemisium. Not believing this news, they detained the messenger and sent fast ships to verify the information. When the crews confirmed the truth, the entire fleet sailed to Artemisium at dawn. They waited there until noon and then proceeded to Histiaea. Upon arrival, they took control of the city of Histiaea and occupied all the villages along the coast of the Ellopian region, which was part of Histiaea's territory. 
24. While they were in Histiaea, Xerxes sent a messenger to the fleet. Before doing so, he made some arrangements: out of the twenty thousand soldiers who had died at Thermopylae, he left about a thousand visible and buried the rest in trenches, covering them with leaves and dirt so that the fleet members wouldn't see them. When the messenger arrived in Histiaea, he gathered all the men from the fleet and said, "Allies, King Xerxes allows anyone who wishes to leave their post and come to see how he fights against the foolish men who thought they could defeat the king's power." 
25. After the announcement, boats were in high demand, as many people wanted to see the aftermath of the battle. They crossed over and observed the fallen soldiers. Everyone assumed that the dead Greeks were all Lacedaemonians and Thespians, although there were also helots among them. However, those who crossed over weren't fooled by Xerxes' attempt to hide his own casualties, as it was quite obvious: a thousand Persians lay dead in plain sight, while the four thousand Greeks were all gathered in one place. They spent the entire day observing the scene, and the next day, the sailors returned to their fleet in Histiaea, while Xerxes' army continued its march. 
26. A few deserters from Arcadia, who were looking for work and a better life, had joined the Persians. They were brought before the king, and the Persians asked them what the Greeks were doing. One of the deserters spoke on behalf of the group, saying that the Greeks were celebrating the Olympic festival and watching sports and horse races. The Persian then asked what prize the Greeks were competing for. The deserter explained that the winner would receive an olive wreath as a crown. Hearing this, Tigranes, the son of Artabanus, made a remarkable statement (although the king considered him a coward for it). He exclaimed, "My goodness, Mardonius, what kind of men have you put us up against? They're not fighting for money, but for the glory of achievement!" That was Tigranes' memorable remark. 
27. Shortly after the unfortunate event at Thermopylae, the Thessalians sent a messenger to the Phocians, as they had a long-standing grudge against them, which had only grown stronger due to recent events. A few years before the king's expedition, the Thessalians and their allies had attacked Phocis with their entire army but were defeated and badly treated by the Phocians. During the siege on Parnassus, the Phocians had a diviner named Tellias from Elis with them. Tellias came up with a clever plan: he covered six hundred of the bravest Phocians and their armor with gypsum and led them to attack the Thessalians at night, instructing them to kill anyone they saw who wasn't covered in white. The Thessalian guards were the first to see these men and fled in fear, mistakenly believing it was something supernatural. Following the guards, the entire Thessalian army fled as well. The Phocians took control of four thousand dead bodies and their shields, dedicating half of them at Abae and the rest at Delphi. A tenth of their spoils from the battle was used to create the large statues surrounding the tripod in front of the shrine at Delphi, and similar statues were dedicated at Abae. 
28. The Phocians had previously dealt with the Thessalian infantry during the siege. When the Thessalian cavalry entered their territory, the Phocians came up with a deadly plan. They dug a large pit near the pass at Hyampolis and filled it with empty jars. They then covered the pit with soil, making it blend in with the surrounding ground, and waited for the Thessalians to arrive. The Thessalian cavalry charged forward, intending to drive the Phocians away, but instead, they fell into the hidden pit filled with jars. As a result, their horses' legs were broken, causing significant harm to the Thessalian forces. 
29. The Thessalians had never forgiven the Phocians for these two incidents, and now they sent a messenger with the following message: "People of Phocis, it's time to admit that you are no match for us. Even before, the Greeks favored us over you when we were on their side, and now we have gained significant influence with the foreign forces, which allows us to take away your lands and enslave you. However, despite our ability to do so, we don't hold any grudges against you for the past. All you need to do is pay us fifty talents of silver as compensation for your actions, and we promise to protect your land from any threats." 
30. The Thessalians made an offer to the Phocians. However, the Phocians were the only ones in the region who refused to join the Persians, mainly because of their hatred for the Thessalians. If the Thessalians had supported the Greeks, the Phocians would have most likely sided with the Persians. In response to the Thessalians' offer, the Phocians said they wouldn't pay any money. They told the Thessalians that they could join the Persians if they wanted to, but the Phocians would not willingly betray the Greek cause. 
31. When the Thessalians received the Phocians' response, they became angry and decided to guide the foreign forces through the region. They led the invaders from Trachis into Doris, a narrow strip of Dorian land about thirty furlongs wide, located between the Malian and Phocian territories. This area, once known as Dryopian, was the homeland of the Dorians in the Peloponnese. The foreign forces did not harm the Dorian territory during their invasion, as the people there had sided with the Persians, and the Thessalians wanted to protect them. 
32. When the foreign forces moved from Doris into Phocis, they couldn't capture the Phocians, as many of them had fled to the heights of Mount Parnassus. The peak called Tithorea, located near the town of Neon, provided enough space for a large number of people. The Phocians took their belongings there, while others left the region and went to the Ozolian Locrians, where the town of Amphissa overlooks the Crisaean plain. As the Thessalians guided the foreign army, they ravaged the entire Phocis region. They destroyed and burned everything they came across, including towns and temples. 
33. As the foreign forces marched along the Cephisus River, they destroyed everything in their path, burning the towns of Drymus, Charadra, Erochus, Tethronium, Amphicaea, Neon, Pediea, Tritea, Elatea, Hyampolis, Parapotamii, and Abae. In Abae, there was a wealthy temple dedicated to Apollo, filled with treasures and offerings, and a place for divination. The invaders plundered and burned this temple as well. They also chased and captured some of the Phocians near the mountains. Tragically, several women lost their lives due to the excessive violence inflicted upon them by the invaders. 
34. After passing Parapotamii, the foreign forces arrived at Panopea. At this point, their army split into two groups. The larger and stronger group, led by Xerxes, headed towards Athens and entered the region of Orchomenus in Boeotia. The entire population of Boeotia sided with the Persians, and men from Macedonia, sent by Alexander, protected their towns, each in their designated areas. This protection was meant to show Xerxes that the Boeotians were loyal to the Persian cause. 
35. The foreign army split into two groups, as mentioned earlier. One group, led by guides, headed towards the temple at Delphi, with Mount Parnassus on their right. They also destroyed every part of Phocis they passed through, burning the towns of Panopeans, Daulii, and Aeolidae. Their goal was to plunder the temple at Delphi and present its riches to Xerxes. It is said that Xerxes had a better understanding of the most valuable items in the temple than of those in his own palace, particularly the offerings made by Croesus, son of Alyattes. These offerings were widely known and discussed. 
36. When the people of Delphi heard about the approaching army, they became very scared. In their fear, they asked the oracle if they should hide the sacred treasure underground or move it to another country. The god replied that they shouldn't move anything, as he could protect his own possessions. After hearing this, the Delphians focused on their own safety. They sent their children and women to Achaia, across the sea. Most of the men went up to the peaks of Mount Parnassus and hid their belongings in the Corycian cave, while some fled to Amphissa in Locris. In the end, all the Delphians left the town except for sixty men and the prophet. 
37. As the foreign forces approached and could see the temple, the prophet named Aceratus noticed sacred weapons, which were not to be touched by anyone, had been moved from the inner chamber and placed in front of the shrine. He went to inform the Delphians about this miraculous event. However, when the invaders quickly reached the temple of Athena Pronaea, they experienced even greater miracles. It was amazing to see the weapons of war appear outside the shrine on their own, but what happened next was even more astonishing. As the foreign forces neared the temple of Athena Pronaea, they were struck by lightning from the sky. Additionally, two large pieces of Mount Parnassus broke off and came crashing down among them with a loud noise, crushing many of the invaders. Along with this, a shout and a victorious cry were heard coming from the temple of Athena. 
38. All these events caused panic among the foreign forces, and the Delphians, noticing their retreat, attacked them and killed many. The remaining invaders fled back to Boeotia. The returning barbarians reported, as I have been told, that they had witnessed other supernatural signs in addition to the ones mentioned earlier. They claimed that two warriors, larger than any human, had chased and killed many of them. 
39. The Delphians believe that these two warriors were their local heroes, Phylacus and Autonous. Phylacus' shrine is located near the temple, above the shrine of Athena Pronaea, and close to the road, while Autonous' shrine is near the Castalian spring, beneath the Hyarapean Peak. In my time, the rocks that fell from Mount Parnassus could still be seen, lying in the area of Athena Pronaea, where they had crashed through the foreign forces. This was how those men left the temple. 
40. At the request of the Athenians, the Greek fleet sailed from Artemisium and arrived at Salamis. The Athenians wanted them to come to Salamis so they could safely move their children and women out of Attica and discuss their next steps. Their previous plans had failed, so they needed to discuss the current situation. They had expected to find the entire population of the Peloponnese in Boeotia, ready to face the foreign forces, but that wasn't the case. Instead, they discovered that the people were fortifying the Isthmus, prioritizing the defense of the Peloponnese and ignoring everything else. Upon learning this, the Athenians asked the fleet to come to Salamis. 
41. As the others arrived at Salamis, the Athenians landed in their own country. Upon arrival, they announced that every Athenian should save their children and servants in the best way possible. As a result, most of them sent their families to Troezen, while some went to Aegina and Salamis. They were eager to ensure everyone's safety, not only because of the oracle's guidance but also due to a local belief: the Athenians claim that a large snake lives in the sacred area, guarding the acropolis. They believe this so strongly that they even provide monthly offerings of a honey-cake to the snake. Until this point, the honey-cake had always been eaten, but this time it remained untouched. The priestess interpreted this as a sign that the goddess had abandoned the acropolis, which made the Athenians even more determined to leave the city. Once they had moved everyone to safety, they returned to their camp. 
42. When the ships from Artemisium arrived at Salamis, the rest of the Greek fleet, which had gathered at Troezen, joined them. They had been ordered to assemble at Pogon, Troezen's harbor. Now, even more ships and cities were involved than those that had fought at Artemisium. The fleet was still led by Eurybiades, son of Euryclides, a Spartan but not of royal blood. Among all the ships, the Athenians provided the largest number and the most reliable vessels. 
43. The following groups participated in the war: from the Peloponnese, the Lacedaemonians provided sixteen ships; the Corinthians contributed the same number as at Artemisium; the Sicyonians supplied fifteen ships, the Epidaurians ten, the Troezenians five, and the Hermioneans three. All of these groups, except for the Hermioneans, were Dorian and Macedonian, originally coming from Erineus, Pindus, and the Dryopian region. The Hermioneans were Dryopians, who had been driven out of the area now known as Doris by Herakles and the Malians. 
44. The following groups from the mainland outside the Peloponnese participated in the war: the Athenians provided the largest contribution with 180 ships. They did this alone, as the Plataeans did not fight alongside the Athenians at Salamis for a specific reason: when the Greeks left Artemisium and were near Chalcis, the Plataeans went to the opposite shore of Boeotia to move their families to safety. In doing so, they were left behind. In the past, when the Pelasgians ruled the region now known as Hellas, the Athenians were Pelasgians and were called Cranai. When Cecrops became their king, they were named Cecropidae, and when Erechtheus took over, they changed their name to Athenians. However, when Ion, son of Xuthus, became the commander of the Athenian army, they were named Ionians after him. 
45. The Megarians contributed the same number of ships as they did at Artemisium. The Ampraciots joined the fight with seven ships, and the Leucadians, who are Dorians from Corinth, supported with three ships. 
46. The islanders contributed to the war effort as follows: the Aeginetans provided thirty ships, using their most seaworthy vessels for the battle at Salamis while keeping the others to protect their own land. The Aeginetans are Dorians from Epidaurus, and their island was once called Oenone. The Chalcidians joined with the same twenty ships they had at Artemisium, as did the Eretrians with their seven ships; both groups are Ionians. The Ceans, who are Ionians from Athens, participated with the same ships as before. The Naxians contributed four ships, even though they were initially sent to support the Persians like the other islanders. However, they decided to join the Greeks instead, encouraged by Democritus, a respected town leader and trireme captain at the time. The Naxians are Ionians descended from Athens. The Styrians provided the same number of ships as at Artemisium, while the Cythnians contributed one trireme and a fifty-oared boat; both groups are Dryopians. The Seriphians, Siphnians, and Melians also participated, as they were the only islanders who had not submitted to the Persians by offering earth and water. 
47. All the people living on this side of Thesprotia and the Acheron river participated in the war. The Thesprotians were neighbors to the Ampraciots and Leucadians, who came from the farthest lands to join the war effort. The only ones living beyond these areas who helped Greece in its time of need were the Crotonians, who contributed one ship. Its captain was Phayllus, a three-time winner in the Pythian games. The Crotonians are of Achaean origin. 
48. All of these groups joined the war with triremes, except for the Melians, Siphnians, and Seriphians, who brought fifty-oared boats. The Melians, who are of Lacedaemonian descent, provided two boats; the Siphnians and Seriphians, who are Ionians from Athens, contributed one boat each. Excluding the fifty-oared boats, the total number of ships was three hundred and seventy-eight. 
49. When the generals from the mentioned cities gathered at Salamis, they held a meeting. Eurybiades suggested that everyone should share their thoughts on the best location for a sea battle, considering that Attica was already lost. They needed to focus on the remaining places. Most of the speakers agreed that they should sail to the Isthmus and fight at sea for the Peloponnese. They reasoned that if they lost the battle at Salamis, they would be trapped on an island with no help available. However, if they fought at the Isthmus, they could retreat to their own lands if needed. 
50. While the generals from the Peloponnese were discussing this plan, an Athenian messenger arrived with news that the barbarians had invaded Attica and were burning everything in their path. Xerxes' army had marched through Boeotia, setting fire to the cities of Thespians and Plataea, which had been abandoned by their inhabitants who fled to the Peloponnese. Now, the army had reached Athens and was causing widespread destruction. The Thebans informed the invaders that Thespia and Plataea had not sided with the Persians, which led to their burning. 
51. The barbarians had started their journey by crossing the Hellespont into Europe, which took them a month. In three more months, they arrived in Attica when Calliades was the leader of Athens. When they captured the city, they found it mostly empty. However, a few Athenians, including the caretakers of the sacred area and some poor people, were still there. They defended themselves by barricading the acropolis with doors and wooden logs. They didn't leave for Salamis not only because they were poor, but also because they believed they had understood an oracle given by the Pythia. The oracle said that a "wooden wall" would be unbreakable, and they thought this referred to their barricade, not the ships, as their safe haven. 
52. The Persians positioned themselves on a hill across from the acropolis, which the Athenians called the Areopagus. They attacked the defenders by setting fire to arrows wrapped in tar and shooting them at the barricade. Despite being in great danger and their barricade failing, the besieged Athenians continued to defend themselves. They refused to surrender when the Pisistratids offered terms and instead found ways to fight back, like rolling large rocks onto the barbarians when they approached the gates. Xerxes was puzzled for a long time, unable to capture the defenders. 
53. Eventually, the barbarians found a solution to their problem, as the oracle had predicted that all of mainland Attica would fall under Persian control. In front of the acropolis, there was an unguarded area behind the gates and the steep climb, where no one believed anyone could climb. However, some men managed to climb up this sheer cliff near the sacred area dedicated to Cecrops' daughter, Aglaurus. When the Athenians saw the invaders had reached the acropolis, some jumped off the walls to their deaths, while others fled into the inner chamber. The first Persians to reach the top went to the gates, opened them, and killed those who had sought refuge. After destroying everything, they looted the sacred area and set fire to the entire acropolis. 
54. Xerxes successfully captured Athens and sent a rider to Susa to inform Artabanus of his victory. The day after sending the message, he gathered the Athenian exiles who were with him and asked them to go to the acropolis and perform their traditional sacrifices. This request might have been due to a dream he had or because he felt guilty for burning the sacred area. The Athenian exiles followed his orders and carried out the sacrifices. 
55. I mention this for a specific reason. Inside the acropolis, there is a shrine dedicated to Erechtheus, known as the "Earthborn." Within the shrine, there is an olive tree and a saltwater pool. The Athenians believe that these were placed there by Poseidon and Athena as symbols during their competition for the land. The olive tree was burned by the barbarians along with the rest of the sacred area. However, the day after the burning, when the Athenians were ordered by the king to perform sacrifices, they saw a new shoot about a cubit long growing from the tree stump and shared this news. 
56. When the news about the Athenian acropolis reached the Greeks at Salamis, some of the Peloponnesian generals were so scared that they didn't wait for a decision on the proposed plan. Instead, they quickly got into their ships and prepared to flee. The remaining generals decided that the fleet should fight for the Isthmus. As night fell, they ended their meeting and returned to their ships. 
57. When Themistocles returned to his ship, an Athenian named Mnesiphilus asked him about the decision made. Upon learning that they planned to sail to the Isthmus and fight for the Peloponnese, Mnesiphilus said, "If they leave Salamis, you won't be fighting for just one country anymore. Everyone will go back to their own city, and neither Eurybiades nor anyone else will be able to stop the army from breaking apart. Greece will be ruined by poor planning. If there's any way you can convince Eurybiades to change his mind and stay here, go and try to reverse this decision." 
58. Themistocles was very happy with this advice. He didn't respond but went straight to Eurybiades' ship. When he got there, he said he wanted to discuss something important, so Eurybiades invited him aboard to share his thoughts. Themistocles sat next to him and shared everything he had heard from Mnesiphilus, acting as if it was his own idea and adding more details. In the end, he successfully convinced Eurybiades to leave the ship and gather the generals for a war council. 
59. When the generals gathered and before Eurybiades could explain why he called the meeting, Themistocles started speaking passionately about his urgent request. While he was talking, the Corinthian general Adeimantus, son of Ocytus, interrupted, "Themistocles, in games, those who start early get punished." Themistocles quickly replied, "But those who are left behind don't win any prizes." 
60. Themistocles responded calmly to the Corinthian and didn't repeat his earlier argument to Eurybiades about the allies scattering if they left Salamis. Instead, he presented a different point of view, saying, "You have the power to save Greece if you listen to me and stay here to fight, rather than following others' advice and moving your ships to the Isthmus. Let me explain the benefits of each plan. If you fight at the Isthmus, you'll be in the open sea, which is not in our favor since our ships are heavier and fewer. You'll also lose Salamis, Megara, and Aegina, even if everything else goes well. Their land army will follow their fleet, and you'll lead them to the Peloponnese, putting all of Greece at risk. However, if you follow my advice, you'll see these benefits: First, by fighting with our few ships against their many in the narrow strait, we have a better chance of winning, as it's to our advantage to fight in a confined space and theirs to fight in a wide area. Second, Salamis will be safe, where we've taken our children and women. By staying here, you'll still be defending the Peloponnese just as much as at the Isthmus, and you won't lead the enemy there if you make the right decision. If things go as I expect and we win the naval battle, the enemy won't reach the Isthmus. They'll only get as far as Attica and then leave in disarray. This way, we'll save Megara, Aegina, and Salamis, where it's prophesied that we'll defeat our enemies. People usually succeed when they have well-thought-out plans. If their plans are unreasonable, the gods don't support their intentions." 
61. As Themistocles spoke, Adeimantus the Corinthian criticized him again, suggesting that a man without a city should stay quiet and that Eurybiades shouldn't listen to someone without a city. He said this because Athens had been captured and occupied. This time, Themistocles strongly defended himself and the Athenians, arguing that as long as they had two hundred ships with crews, they still had a city and land greater than the Corinthians. He also claimed that no other Greeks could stop the Athenians if they decided to attack. 
62. Then, Themistocles focused on Eurybiades, speaking more passionately than before, "If you stay here, you'll be a great leader. If not, you'll destroy Greece. Our power lies in our ships, so please listen to me. If you don't, we'll quickly gather our families and move to Siris in Italy, a place that has been ours since ancient times, and where prophecies say we must establish a colony. You'll remember my words when you no longer have allies like us." 
63. After hearing Themistocles' words, Eurybiades changed his decision. I believe his main concern was that the Athenians might abandon them if they sailed to the Isthmus. Without the Athenians, the remaining forces wouldn't stand a chance against the enemy. So, Eurybiades chose to stay and fight. 
64. Following this heated debate, Eurybiades made up his mind, and the men at Salamis got ready to fight right where they were. The next day, at sunrise, there was an earthquake on both land and sea. They decided to pray to the gods and ask for help from the sons of Aeacus. After making this decision, they prayed to all the gods, invited Ajax and Telamon to join them from Salamis, and sent a ship to Aegina to bring Aeacus and his sons. 
65. Dicaeus, the son of Theocydes, was an Athenian exile who had gained importance among the Medes. He said that when Xerxes' army was destroying the land of Attica and no Athenians were around, he and Demaratus, a Lacedaemonian, were on the Thriasian plain. They saw a cloud of dust approaching from Eleusis, as if created by around thirty thousand people. They wondered who could be causing such a dust cloud and then heard a cry. The cry sounded like the "Iacchus" from the Eleusinian mysteries. Demaratus, unfamiliar with the Eleusinian rites, asked Dicaeus about the sound. Dicaeus replied, "Demaratus, this sound means a great disaster will likely happen to the king's army. Since Attica is empty, this divine voice must be coming from Eleusis to help the Athenians and their allies. If it goes to the Peloponnese, the king and his mainland army will be in danger. But if it heads towards the ships at Salamis, the king's fleet will be at risk. Every year, the Athenians celebrate this festival for the Mother and the Maiden, and any Athenian or other Greek can participate. The 'Iacchus' cry you hear is from this festival." Demaratus responded, "Stay quiet and don't tell anyone else about this. If the king hears your words, you'll lose your life, and neither I nor anyone else can save you. So, keep quiet. The gods will take care of the army." After the dust and cry, a cloud rose and floated towards Salamis, where the Greek camp was. This made them understand that Xerxes' fleet would be destroyed. Dicaeus, the son of Theocydes, used to tell this story, referring to Demaratus and others as witnesses. 
66. When the people with Xerxes' fleet saw the disastrous battle at Thermopylae in Laconia, they moved from Trachis to Histiaea. They waited for three days before sailing through the Euripus channel, and in another three days, they arrived at Phalerum, the port of Athens. I believe the number of invaders who attacked Athens by land and sea was no less than those who came to Sepias and Thermopylae. The losses from the storm, the battle at Thermopylae, and the naval fights at Artemisium were balanced by those who hadn't yet joined the king: the Melians, Dorians, Locrians, and all the Boeotian forces except the Thespians and Plataeans; as well as the Carystians, Andrians, Teneans, and all the other islanders, except the five cities I mentioned earlier. The deeper the Persians went into Greece, the more nations followed them. 
67. All of them went to Athens, except for the Parians, who stayed behind in Cythnus to see how the war would unfold. When the rest arrived at Phalerum, Xerxes went to the ships, wanting to talk with the sailors and hear their opinions. He sat on his throne, and the rulers of all the nations and the fleet's leaders were summoned. They sat according to the honor the king had given them, with the king of Sidon first, followed by the king of Tyre, and then the others. Once they were seated in order, Xerxes sent Mardonius to ask each of them if they should engage in a sea battle. 
68. Mardonius began questioning them, starting with the Sidonian. All of them agreed that they should fight at sea, but Artemisia had a different opinion. She said, "Tell the king, Mardonius, that I, who was neither the most cowardly in the sea battles off Euboea nor performed the least feats of arms, have this to say: 'Master, I will share my honest opinion, which I believe is best for your cause. I advise you not to use your ships and avoid fighting at sea. Our enemies are much stronger at sea than we are, just as men are stronger than women. Why risk everything in a sea battle? You have already captured Athens, which was your goal, and you control the rest of Greece. No one is stopping you. Those who opposed you have been punished. I will tell you how I think things will turn out for your enemies: If you don't rush into a sea battle and keep your ships here, staying close to land or even advancing into the Peloponnese, you will easily achieve your goals. The Greeks won't be able to resist you for long, and they will scatter, each returning to their own cities. I've learned that they don't have enough food on this island, and if you lead your army against the Peloponnese, those who came from there won't stay idle, nor will they want to fight at sea for Athens. However, if you rush into a sea battle right away, I'm afraid that if your fleet is defeated, it may also harm your land army. Also, my King, remember this: Good people often have bad slaves, and bad people often have good slaves. You, being the best among men, have bad slaves who are considered your allies, like the Egyptians, Cyprians, Cilicians, and Pamphylians, who are not helpful at all.'" 
69. When Artemisia shared her thoughts with Mardonius, those who liked her were worried, thinking she would face trouble from the king for advising against a sea battle. However, those who were jealous of her, because she was highly respected among the allies, were happy with her response, thinking she would be killed. But when Xerxes heard about the advice, he was very pleased with Artemisia's opinion. He had already thought highly of her, and now he praised her even more. Nevertheless, he decided to follow the majority's advice, as he believed that they had fought poorly on purpose at Euboea because he wasn't there. This time, he planned to watch the battle himself. 
70. When the order to sail was given, they headed towards Salamis and calmly lined up their ships. However, there wasn't enough daylight left for them to fight, so they prepared for the battle the next day. The Greeks, especially those from the Peloponnese, were filled with fear and dread. They were worried because they were stationed in Salamis and had to fight at sea to defend the land of the Athenians. If they lost, they would be trapped on an island and under siege, leaving their own land unprotected. 
71. On that same night, the barbarians' land army began marching towards the Peloponnese. The Peloponnesians had tried everything to prevent the invasion by land. When they heard that Leonidas and his men at Thermopylae had been killed, they quickly gathered from their cities and positioned themselves at the Isthmus. Their leader was Cleombrotus, son of Anaxandrides and brother of Leonidas. Once they were in position at the Isthmus, they destroyed the Scironian road and decided to build a wall across the Isthmus. With tens of thousands of people working together, they quickly completed the task, using stones, bricks, logs, and baskets full of sand. They worked non-stop, day and night, without any rest. 
72. The Greeks who gathered at the Isthmus included the Lacedaemonians, all the Arcadians, Eleans, Corinthians, Sicyonians, Epidaurians, Phliasians, Troezenians, and Hermioneans. These were the ones who came together, concerned for the safety of Greece. The rest of the Peloponnesians didn't seem to care, even though the Olympian and Carnean festivals had already passed. 
73. Seven different groups of people live in the Peloponnese. Two of them, the Arcadians and Cynurians, have always lived there. The Achaeans have never left the Peloponnese, but they moved from their original land to another area. The other four groups, the Dorians, Aetolians, Dryopians, and Lemnians, came from other places. The Dorians have many famous cities, the Aetolians have only Elis, the Dryopians have Hermione and Asine near Laconian Cardamyle, and the Lemnians have all the Paroreatae. The Cynurians have always lived there and are the only Ionians, but over time they have become more like the Dorians because of Argive influence. They include the Orneatae and the perioikoi. All the other cities from these seven groups, except the ones I mentioned, stayed neutral. To be honest, by staying neutral, they were actually siding with the enemy. 
74. The people at the Isthmus were working extremely hard because everything they had was at risk, and they didn't think the ships would be successful. Meanwhile, those at Salamis heard about their efforts but were still very worried, not for themselves but for the Peloponnese. At first, they quietly discussed their concerns about Eurybiades' poor decisions among themselves, but eventually, the issue became more public. They held a meeting and debated the same topics as before: some argued that they should sail to the Peloponnese and fight for that land, instead of staying and fighting for a land that was already captured; however, the Athenians, Aeginetans, and Megarians insisted that they should stay and defend themselves. 
75. When the Peloponnesians were disagreeing with him, Themistocles secretly left the meeting and sent a man by boat to the Median fleet with a message. The man's name was Sicinnus, and he was Themistocles' servant and looked after his sons. Later, Themistocles helped Sicinnus become a citizen of Thespian and gave him money. Sicinnus went to the barbarian generals by boat and said, "The Athenian general sent me without the other Greeks knowing. He supports the king and wants your side to win, not the Greeks'. He told me that the Greeks are scared and planning to run away, and you can do something great if you don't let them escape. They don't all agree, and they won't fight you anymore. Instead, you'll see them fighting each other, with some on your side and some not." After telling them this, he left. 
76. Believing the message, they first placed many Persians on the small island of Psyttalea, which is between Salamis and the mainland. At midnight, they moved their western wing in a circle towards Salamis, and those positioned at Ceos and Cynosura also set sail, filling the passage up to Munychia with their ships. They arranged their ships this way to trap the Greeks at Salamis, making them pay for the battles at Artemisium. The reason they placed Persians on the island called Psyttalea was that when the battle happened, most of the men and wreckage would end up there, as the island was in the path of the upcoming battle. The Persians would be able to save some of those who washed up and kill the others. They did all of this quietly, so their enemies wouldn't hear them, working through the night without sleep. 
77. I can't argue that oracles aren't true, and I don't want to question them when their messages are clear. Look at this example: "When the sacred headland of golden-sworded Artemis and Cynosura by the sea are connected by ships, after destroying bright Athens with crazy hope, divine justice will put an end to powerful greed, the child of arrogance, with a terrible desire to consume everything." "Bronze will clash with bronze, and Ares will turn the sea red with blood. Zeus, who sees far, and the great Victory will bring freedom to Greece." Considering this, I don't dare to say anything against Bacis when it comes to oracles when he speaks so clearly, and I won't agree with others who do. 
78. At Salamis, the generals were having a heated debate. They didn't know that the enemy ships had already surrounded them, as they thought the enemies were still in the same place where they had seen them during the day. 
79. While the generals were arguing, Aristides, an Athenian and the son of Lysimachus, came over from Aegina. Even though he had been banished by the people, I found out through my research that he was the best and most fair man in Athens. Despite being enemies with Themistocles, Aristides put aside their differences due to the seriousness of the situation and called him out to talk. He had already heard that the Peloponnesians wanted to sail to the Isthmus, so when Themistocles came out, he said, "At all times, especially now, we should compete to see who can do more good for our country. It doesn't matter if the Peloponnesians talk about leaving this place, because I've seen with my own eyes that even if the Corinthians and Eurybiades wanted to, they wouldn't be able to escape. We are surrounded by the enemy. Go and tell them this." 
80. Themistocles replied, "Your encouragement is very helpful, and you bring good news. You've seen exactly what I wanted to happen. You should know that I'm the reason the Medes are doing this. Since the Greeks didn't want to fight, it was necessary to force them against their will. As you've brought good news, you should tell them yourself. If I say these things, they might think I made it up, and they won't believe that the barbarians are doing this. Go in and inform them about the situation. It's best if they believe you, but even if they find it hard to believe, it doesn't matter. They won't be able to escape if we're truly surrounded on all sides, as you say." 
81. Aristides went in and told them that he had come from Aegina and had barely managed to get past the blockade when he sailed out, as all the Greek camp was surrounded by Xerxes' ships. He urged them to get ready to defend themselves. After saying this, he left, and once again, a disagreement broke out among the generals. Most of them didn't believe the news. 
82. While the generals were still doubtful, a ship from Tenian deserters arrived, led by Panaetius, the son of Sosimenes. This ship brought them the complete truth. Because of this action, the Tenians were honored on the tripod at Delphi along with those who had defeated the barbarians. With this ship that joined them at Salamis and the Lemnian ship that had joined earlier at Artemisium, the Greek fleet reached its full strength of 380 ships, as it had been short by two ships before. 
83. When the generals believed the Tenians' words, the Greeks got ready for the sea battle. At dawn, they held a meeting with the soldiers, and Themistocles gave the best speech among the others. His whole speech compared the good and bad aspects of human nature and life. He finished his speech by telling them to choose the better aspects and then ordered them to board the ships. As they were getting on the ships, the ship that had gone to fetch the sons of Aeacus returned from Aegina. 
84. Then the Greeks set sail with all their ships, and as they were heading out to sea, the barbarians quickly attacked them. The rest of the Greeks started to retreat and tried to return their ships to the shore, but Ameinias, an Athenian from Pallene, charged forward and hit an enemy ship. When his ship got stuck and the crew couldn't free it, the others came to help Ameinias and joined the battle. The Athenians say that the sea battle started this way, but the people from Aegina say that the ship which had gone to Aegina to get the sons of Aeacus was the one that started it. There is also a story that a ghostly woman appeared to them, shouting orders loud enough for the entire Greek fleet to hear, scolding them first by saying, "Crazy men, how long will you keep retreating?" 
85. The Phoenicians were positioned against the Athenians, taking the western side towards Eleusis. The Ionians were against the Lacedaemonians, on the eastern side towards Piraeus. Some of them fought poorly, following Themistocles' instructions, but most did not. I can name many captains who captured Greek ships, but I will only mention Theomestor, son of Androdamas, and Phylacus, son of Histiaeus, both from Samos. I mention them because Theomestor was made the ruler of Samos by the Persians for his achievement, and Phylacus was recognized as a friend of the king and given a lot of land. In the Persian language, the king's friends are called "orosangae." 
86. So that's what happened with them. But most of the ships at Salamis were sunk, some by the Athenians and some by the Aeginetans. The Greeks fought in an organized line, while the barbarians were disorganized and didn't plan their actions. So, it was expected to turn out the way it did. However, the barbarians were much braver that day than they had been at Euboea, because they were all afraid of Xerxes and thought that the king was watching each of them. 
87. I can't describe exactly how each of the other barbarians or Greeks fought, but this is what happened to Artemisia, which made the king respect her even more: When the king's side was in chaos, Artemisia's ship was being chased by an Athenian ship. She couldn't escape because other allied ships were blocking her way, and her ship was closest to the enemy. So, she decided to do something that actually helped her: while being chased by the Athenian ship, she attacked and sank an allied ship with a Calyndian crew and Damasithymus, the king of the Calyndians, on board. I don't know if she had a disagreement with him earlier or if she did this on purpose, or if the Calyndian ship just happened to be in her way. But when she sank it, she was lucky to gain two benefits. The captain of the Athenian ship, seeing her attack a ship with a barbarian crew, thought that Artemisia's ship was either Greek or had switched sides to fight for them, so he left her alone and went after other ships. 
88. So, Artemisia managed to escape and avoid destruction, and her actions actually earned her even more respect from King Xerxes. It's said that the king, while watching the battle, saw her ship attack the other one, and someone nearby said, "Master, do you see how well Artemisia is fighting and how she has sunk an enemy ship?" When he asked if it was really Artemisia's doing, they confirmed it, recognizing her ship's markings, and they thought the destroyed ship was an enemy. As I mentioned, all of this brought her good fortune, and also, no one from the Calyndian ship survived to accuse her. It's said that Xerxes responded to the news by saying, "My men have become women, and my women men." That's what they say Xerxes said. 
89. In this battle, the general Ariabignes, son of Darius and brother of Xerxes, died. Many other famous Persians, Medes, and allies also died, but only a few Greeks, as they knew how to swim. Those whose ships were sunk swam to Salamis, unless they were killed in the fight, while many of the barbarians drowned in the sea because they couldn't swim. Most of the ships were sunk when the ones in front started to flee, as those in the back tried to move forward with their ships to show their skills to the king, but ended up crashing into their own side's fleeing ships. 
90. During this chaos, some Phoenicians whose ships had been destroyed went to the king and accused the Ionians of treason, claiming that they were responsible for the lost ships. However, the Ionian generals were not executed, and the Phoenicians who accused them were punished, as I will explain. While they were talking, a Samothracian ship attacked an Attic ship. The Attic ship sank, and an Aeginetan ship came and sank the Samothracian ship. But the Samothracians, skilled in throwing javelins, managed to knock the fighters off the ship that had sunk theirs and took control of it. This event saved the Ionians. Xerxes, deeply upset, blamed everyone. When he saw the Ionians performing this great act, he turned to the Phoenicians and ordered their heads to be cut off, so they wouldn't falsely accuse nobler men. Whenever Xerxes, sitting under the mountain opposite Salamis called Aegaleos, saw one of his own men achieve something in the battle, he asked who did it, and his scribes recorded the captain's name along with his father and city of residence. The presence of Ariaramnes, a Persian and a friend of the Ionians, further contributed to the Phoenicians' misfortune. That's how the Phoenicians were dealt with. 
91. The barbarians were defeated and attempted to escape by sailing towards Phalerum, but the Aeginetans were waiting for them in the strait and carried out remarkable actions. During the chaos, the Athenians destroyed the ships that either fought back or tried to flee, while the Aeginetans targeted those sailing out of the strait. Anyone who managed to escape the Athenians ended up facing the Aeginetans. 
92. While Themistocles was chasing a ship, his ship met with Polycritus', an Aeginetan and son of Crius. Polycritus had attacked a Sidonian ship, which had previously captured an Aeginetan ship that was on watch near Sciathus. On that ship was Pytheas, son of Ischenous, who was admired by the Persians for his bravery even when severely wounded. They had kept him on their ship. Now, the Sidonian ship carrying Pytheas and the Persians was captured, and Pytheas returned safely to Aegina. When Polycritus saw the Attic ship, he recognized it by the flagship's marking and shouted at Themistocles, making fun of him and accusing the Aeginetans of siding with the Medes. After attacking an enemy ship, Polycritus hurled these insults at Themistocles. The barbarians with remaining ships fled and reached Phalerum, protected by the land army. 
93. In this battle, the Aeginetans were considered the bravest among the Greeks, followed by the Athenians. The most courageous individuals were Polycritus from Aegina and Eumenes from Anagyrus and Aminias from Pallene, both Athenians. Aminias was the one who chased Artemisia. If he had known she was on that ship, he wouldn't have stopped until he either captured it or was captured himself. The Athenian captains were given such orders, and a reward of ten thousand drachmas was offered to whoever captured her alive, as they were angry that a woman waged war against Athens. However, as mentioned earlier, she escaped, and the others with surviving ships also reached Phalerum. 
94. The Athenians claim that during the battle, the Corinthian general Adeimantus, overwhelmed by fear and confusion, raised his sails and fled. Seeing their flagship retreat, the Corinthians followed suit. However, as they were fleeing past the sacred temple of Athena Sciras on Salamis, a mysterious boat appeared, seemingly sent by divine intervention. The boat approached the Corinthians, who were unaware of the fleet's situation. The boat's arrival was considered a divine act because, as it neared the ships, the people on board told Adeimantus that he had abandoned the Greeks, but they were actually defeating their enemies and achieving victory. Adeimantus didn't believe them, so they offered to be taken as hostages and killed if the Greeks were not found to be winning. Hearing this, Adeimantus and the others turned their ships around and returned to the fleet, only to find the battle was over. The Athenians spread this story about the Corinthians, but the Corinthians themselves strongly disagree, believing they were among the bravest in the battle. The rest of Greece supports their claim. 
95. Aristides, son of Lysimachus, an Athenian whom I previously mentioned as a brave man, took action during the chaos at Salamis. He gathered many armed men who were stationed along the shore of Salamis, transported them across to the island of Psyttalea, and they killed all the Persians who were on that island. 
96. After the battle, the Greeks towed as many shipwrecks as they could find back to Salamis, preparing for another possible battle, thinking that the king might still use his remaining ships. A west wind had pushed many of the wrecks to a shore in Attica called Colias. This event not only fulfilled the prophecies of Bacis and Musaeus about the battle but also confirmed an earlier prediction by Lysistratus, an Athenian fortune-teller, regarding the shipwrecks washing up on that shore. The meaning of this prophecy had puzzled the Greeks: "The Colian women will cook with oars." This was meant to happen after the king had left. 
97. When Xerxes realized the extent of the disaster, he worried that the Ionians might suggest to the Greeks, if they hadn't thought of it themselves, to sail to the Hellespont and destroy the bridges. Trapped in Europe, he would be in great danger, so he decided to flee. To avoid being discovered by the Greeks or his own men, he tried to build a dike across to Salamis and connected Phoenician cargo ships to serve as both a bridge and a wall, as if preparing for another sea battle. Everyone who saw this assumed he was determined to stay and fight, but Mardonius, who knew the king's intentions best, was not fooled. While making these preparations, Xerxes sent a messenger to Persia to report the catastrophe. 
98. While Xerxes was making his plans, he sent a messenger to Persia with news of his current misfortune. These messengers were the fastest way to deliver messages, thanks to the Persians' clever system. It is said that there were as many men and horses along the road as there were days in the entire journey, each positioned a day's travel apart. These messengers were not stopped by snow, rain, heat, or darkness, and they completed their assigned routes as quickly as possible. The first rider handed off the message to the second, who then passed it to the third, and so on, similar to the Greek torch relay race in honor of Hephaestus. This messenger system was called "angareion" in Persia. 
99. When the first message arrived in Susa, announcing that Xerxes had captured Athens, the Persians who were at home were overjoyed. They covered the roads with myrtle branches, burned incense, and celebrated with feasts and festivities. However, the second message, which followed closely behind the first, left them in shock. They tore their clothes, cried, and lamented non-stop, blaming Mardonius for the situation. Their distress was not so much due to the loss of their ships, but rather because they were worried about Xerxes himself. 
100. The Persians were in a difficult situation until Xerxes himself arrived and put an end to it. Mardonius, seeing that Xerxes was very upset about the sea battle and suspecting that he planned to flee from Athens, thought he would be punished for convincing the king to attack Greece. He believed it was better to risk either conquering Greece or dying honorably while pursuing a noble cause, although he hoped more for the conquest of Greece. Considering all this, he made a suggestion: "My king, don't be sad or too upset about what has happened to us. Our fate doesn't depend on wooden ships, but on men and horses. None of our enemies believe they have achieved a great victory and will dare to face you, nor will anyone from the mainland. Those who opposed us have already paid the price. If you wish, we can immediately attack the Peloponnese, or if you prefer to wait, we can do that too. Don't be discouraged, as the Greeks won't be able to escape punishment for their past and present actions and will eventually become your slaves. It's best to follow my advice, but if you decide to withdraw your army, I have another plan. Don't let the Persians become a laughingstock for the Greeks. If you have suffered losses, it's not the Persians' fault. You can't say that we haven't done everything brave men should do. If Phoenicians, Egyptians, Cyprians, and Cilicians have failed, the Persians have no part in this disaster. Since the Persians are not to blame, listen to me: if you decide not to stay, return home with most of your army. However, let me enslave and deliver Greece to you with 300,000 chosen soldiers from your forces." 
101. When Xerxes heard Mardonius' proposal, he felt as relieved and happy as someone in his situation could be. He told Mardonius that he would think about which of the two plans to follow. As he consulted with the Persians he had called upon, he decided to also seek advice from Artemisia, since she had been the only one to suggest the best course of action during their previous meeting. When Artemisia arrived, Xerxes asked everyone else, including the Persian advisors and guards, to leave. He then explained Mardonius' advice to her: to either attack the Peloponnese, as the Persians and the land army were not responsible for their defeat and were willing to prove themselves, or to let Mardonius choose 300,000 soldiers from the army to enslave Greece while Xerxes returned home with the rest of the troops. Xerxes then asked Artemisia, who had previously advised against the sea battle, to recommend which of the two options would be best for him to follow. 
102. When asked for her advice, Artemisia responded, "It's not easy, my king, to give you the best advice in this situation, but considering the current circumstances, I think it's best for you to return home and let Mardonius stay here with the troops he wants, if he is willing and promises to do as he says. If he succeeds in conquering everything he plans to and his mission goes well, the achievement will be yours, as it will be your servants who have accomplished it. On the other hand, if things don't go as Mardonius expects, it won't be a significant loss as long as you and your family are safe. As long as you and your household are secure, the Greeks will have to fight for their lives many times. If any disaster happens to Mardonius, it won't matter much, and any victory the Greeks achieve won't be a real victory if they only defeat your servant. As for you, you'll be returning home after burning Athens, which was the main goal of your expedition." 
103. Xerxes was pleased with Artemisia's advice, as it aligned with what he had been thinking. In fact, I believe that even if everyone had advised him to stay, he wouldn't have remained, as he was extremely frightened. After thanking Artemisia, he sent her to Ephesus to take care of his illegitimate sons who were with him. 
104. Xerxes sent Hermotimus along with his sons as their guardian. Hermotimus, originally from Pedasa, was the most respected eunuch in Xerxes' court. The people of Pedasa lived near Halicarnassus. Among these people, there was a unique occurrence: whenever something bad was about to happen to the people living around their city, the priestess of Athena would grow a large beard. This had already happened to them twice. 
105. Hermotimus, from Pedasa, had taken revenge for the wrongs done to him more than anyone else we know. He was captured by enemies and sold as a slave to a man named Panionius from Chios, who made a living through terrible actions. Panionius would find good-looking boys, castrate them, and then sell them at high prices in Sardis and Ephesus, as the barbarians valued eunuchs more than unaltered men due to the trust they placed in them. Hermotimus was one of the many boys Panionius had castrated, but his fate wasn't entirely bad. He was brought to King Xerxes along with other gifts, and as time passed, he became the most favored eunuch in the king's court. 
106. While King Xerxes was in Sardis preparing to lead his Persian army against Athens, Hermotimus went to the part of Mysia inhabited by Chians, called Atarneus, for some business. There, he found Panionius. Recognizing him, Hermotimus had a long and friendly conversation with him, telling him that he owed his success to Panionius and promising to make him prosperous in return if he moved his family to live there. Panionius gladly accepted the offer and brought his wife and children. Once Hermotimus had Panionius and his family under his control, he confronted him, asking what harm he or his ancestors had done to Panionius to make him take away his manhood and turn him into nothing. Panionius probably thought the gods wouldn't know about his wicked actions, but their justice had brought him into Hermotimus' hands. Hermotimus then told him that he would be satisfied with the justice he would carry out. With these words, Hermotimus forced Panionius to castrate all four of his own sons. After that, the sons were forced to castrate their father in return. This was how Panionius faced vengeance at the hands of Hermotimus. 
107. After entrusting his sons to Artemisia to be taken to Ephesus, Xerxes called Mardonius and told him to choose whoever he wanted from the army and do his best to fulfill his promises. That's how things went that day. However, during the night, the admirals, following the king's orders, set sail from Phalerum and quickly headed back to the Hellespont to protect the bridges for the king's crossing. As the barbarians approached the "Girdle" during their journey, they mistook some small headlands extending from the mainland for ships and fled for a considerable distance. Once they realized that they were not ships but headlands, they regrouped and continued on their way. 
108. When daylight came, the Greeks saw the land army still in its position and assumed the ships were at Phalerum as well. They prepared to defend themselves, expecting a sea battle. However, when they found out that the ships had left, they immediately decided to chase Xerxes' fleet. They pursued it as far as Andros but couldn't catch sight of it. Once they reached Andros, they held a meeting. Themistocles suggested that they should continue chasing the ships through the islands and then head to the Hellespont to destroy the bridges. Eurybiades, however, disagreed, arguing that breaking the bridges would be the worst thing they could do for Greece. He explained that if the Persian army was trapped in Europe, they would be forced to take action. If they remained inactive, they would neither succeed in their mission nor find a way to return home, and their army would starve. If they were active, they might conquer or make alliances with every town and nation in Europe, living off the resources of Greece. Eurybiades believed that the Persian army would not stay in Europe after their defeat at sea, so they should let them flee to their own country. This way, the war would be fought in their land, not Greece. The other Peloponnesian admirals agreed with this opinion. 
109. When Themistocles realized that he couldn't convince the majority to sail to the Hellespont, he turned to the Athenians. They were the most upset about the Persians' escape and were willing to sail to the Hellespont even if the others wouldn't. He spoke to them, saying that he had often seen and heard of defeated men regaining their strength when cornered. He reminded them that their victory was due to a fortunate turn of events and the help of the gods and heroes. They believed that Asia and Europe were too vast for one wicked and impious man to rule, a man who destroyed temples and disrespected the gods, even going so far as to whip the sea and throw chains into it. Themistocles advised the Athenians to stay in Greece for now, focusing on rebuilding their homes and working diligently on their lands once they had completely driven the foreigners away. He suggested that they could sail to the Hellespont and Ionia the following spring. He said this to gain favor with the Persians, in case he ever needed a place to escape to if he faced trouble with the Athenians—which eventually did happen. 
110. Themistocles spoke with the intention to deceive, and the Athenians followed him. Since he had always been considered wise and had proven himself to be both intelligent and cautious, they were willing to listen to whatever he said. After convincing them, Themistocles immediately sent trustworthy men in a boat to deliver a message to the king, making sure they wouldn't reveal it under any circumstances. One of these men was his servant, Sicinnus. When they arrived in Attica, the rest of the men stayed with the boat while Sicinnus went to see Xerxes. He told the king that Themistocles, the Athenian general and the most valuable and wise among the allies, had sent him with a message. Themistocles had stopped the Greeks from pursuing the Persian ships and destroying the Hellespont bridges as a favor to Xerxes. Now, he advised the king to leave without any obstacles. After delivering the message, the men returned to their boat. 
111. The Greeks, having decided not to chase the enemy ships further or sail to the Hellespont to block their passage, tried to capture the island of Andros. They demanded money from the islanders, but the people of Andros refused to pay. Themistocles told them that the Athenians had come with the help of two powerful gods, Persuasion and Necessity, so the Andrians had no choice but to give them money. In response, the Andrians said that it was no wonder Athens was great and prosperous, with such helpful gods on their side. However, the Andrians themselves were only blessed with a shortage of land and two unhelpful gods, Poverty and Helplessness, who never left their island. Because of these gods, they would not give any money, as the power of Athens could never overcome their inability to pay. 
112. The islanders of Andros were besieged because they refused to give the money that was demanded from them. Themistocles' greed knew no bounds. He used the same agents who had communicated with the king to send threatening messages to other islands. He demanded money and warned that if they didn't pay, he would bring the Greek fleet to attack and capture their islands. As a result, he collected large amounts of money from the people of Carystus and Paros. They were told that Andros was under siege for supporting the Persians and that Themistocles was the most respected general among the Greeks. This scared them into sending money. It's likely that other islands also paid, but it's not certain. However, the people of Carystus didn't escape misfortune despite paying. The Parians, on the other hand, managed to avoid trouble by giving money to Themistocles. Themistocles then left Andros and collected money from the islanders, keeping it a secret from the other generals. 
113. A few days after the sea battle, Xerxes and his troops waited before marching back to Boeotia, following the same route they had taken earlier. Mardonius wanted to ensure the king's safety and believed it was not the right time for war. He thought it would be better to spend the winter in Thessaly and then attack the Peloponnese in the spring. Once they reached Thessaly, Mardonius began selecting troops. He first chose all the Persians known as Immortals, except for their general, Hydarnes, who refused to leave the king's side. He also selected Persian cuirassiers, a thousand horsemen, and soldiers from the Medes, Sacae, Bactrians, and Indians, including both infantry and cavalry. Mardonius chose entire nations and also picked a few individuals from each allied group, focusing on the best fighters and those who had proven their worth. The Persians, known for wearing torques and bracelets, were the largest group selected, followed by the Medes. Although the Medes were as numerous as the Persians, they were not as strong in battle. In total, the selected army, including the horsemen, consisted of three hundred thousand men. 
114. While Mardonius was selecting his army and Xerxes was in Thessaly, the Lacedaemonians received an oracle from Delphi. It told them to demand justice from Xerxes for the death of Leonidas and accept whatever he offered. So, the Spartans quickly sent a messenger to Xerxes. The messenger found the army still together in Thessaly and spoke to Xerxes, saying, "The Lacedaemonians and the Heraclidae of Sparta ask you, king of the Medes, to pay the penalty for the death of their king, whom you killed while he defended Greece." Xerxes laughed at this request. After a while, he pointed to Mardonius, who happened to be standing nearby, and said, "Mardonius here will pay the penalty to those you speak of, as it is appropriate." 
115. The messenger took Xerxes' response and left, while Xerxes allowed Mardonius to stay in Thessaly. Xerxes himself quickly traveled to the Hellespont, reaching the crossing point in 45 days. He returned with almost none of his army, as they had suffered greatly from hunger. Wherever they went, they consumed all the food they could find. If there was no food, they would eat grass, tree bark, and leaves, leaving nothing behind. On top of that, they were struck by disease and dysentery, which caused many deaths. Xerxes left some of the sick behind in various cities, instructing the locals to take care of them. Some were left in Thessaly, others in Siris of Paeonia, and some in Macedonia. When Xerxes had first marched to Greece, he had left the sacred chariot of Zeus in Siris, but he couldn't retrieve it on his way back. The Paeonians had given it to the Thracians, and when Xerxes asked for it, they claimed that the horses had been stolen by hill-dwelling Thracians near the Strymon River's source. 
116. A terrible act was committed by the Thracian king of the Bisaltae and the Crestonian region. He had refused to become Xerxes' slave willingly and had fled to the mountains called Rhodope. He had forbidden his sons to join the army going to Greece, but they ignored his orders. They had always been curious about the war and decided to follow the Persian army. When all six of them returned unharmed, their father punished them by gouging out their eyes. 
117. This was the punishment they received. Meanwhile, the Persians traveled through Thrace towards the crossing point and quickly sailed to Abydos in their ships, as the bridges had been destroyed by a storm. Their journey paused there, and they were given more food than they had during their travels. However, due to overeating and drinking different water, many of the remaining soldiers died. The survivors continued with Xerxes to Sardis. 
118. There is another story about Xerxes' journey back to Asia. When he reached Eion on the Strymon River, he didn't continue by land but instead entrusted his army to Hydarnes to lead them to the Hellespont. Xerxes himself boarded a Phoenician ship and set sail for Asia. During the voyage, a strong wind called the Strymonian stirred up the waves, making the heavily loaded ship struggle due to the many Persians on deck. Fearing for his life, Xerxes asked the ship's pilot if there was any way to survive. The pilot replied that they could only be saved if they got rid of the extra passengers on board. Upon hearing this, Xerxes told the Persians that their king's safety depended on them. They bowed and jumped into the sea, lightening the ship and allowing it to safely reach Asia. When Xerxes disembarked, he rewarded the pilot with a golden crown for saving his life but also beheaded him for causing the deaths of many Persians. 
119. There is another version of Xerxes' return, but I don't believe either the story about the Persians' fate or any other part of it. If the pilot had indeed spoken to Xerxes like that, I think it's highly unlikely that the king would have ordered the Persians on deck, who were of noble blood, to jump into the sea. Instead, he would have probably asked them to go below deck and thrown an equal number of Phoenician rowers overboard. The truth is, as I mentioned earlier, Xerxes returned to Asia by land with his army. 
120. There is more evidence to support this, as it is known that when Xerxes returned to Abdera, he formed a friendly alliance with its people and gifted them a golden sword and a decorated tiara. The people of Abdera claim (though I don't believe them) that it was here where Xerxes, fleeing from Athens, first felt safe and removed his belt. Abdera is closer to the Hellespont than the Strymon and Eion, where they say he boarded a ship. 
121. As for the Greeks, they couldn't capture Andros, so they went to Carystus. After destroying it, they returned to Salamis. They first dedicated three Phoenician triremes to the gods: one at the Isthmus, which remained there until my time; the second at Sunium; and the third at Salamis for Ajax. Then, they divided the spoils and sent a portion to Delphi. From this, they created a twelve-cubit tall statue of a man holding a ship's figurehead. This statue stood in the same place as the golden statue of Alexander the Macedonian. 
122. After sending the offerings to Delphi, the Greeks asked the god on behalf of their country if the offerings were sufficient and if he was satisfied. The god replied that he was content with the offerings from all other Greeks, except for the Aeginetans. He demanded a victory prize from them for the sea battle of Salamis. When the Aeginetans heard this, they dedicated three golden stars mounted on a bronze mast, placed in the corner closest to Croesus' bowl. 
123. After dividing the spoils, the Greeks sailed to the Isthmus to award the prize for the most outstanding performance in the war. When the admirals gathered at Poseidon's altar to vote for the first and second place, each of them voted for themselves, believing they had contributed the most. However, most of them agreed that Themistocles deserved the second place. As a result, each admiral received only one vote, while Themistocles had significantly more votes for the second place. 
124. The Greeks couldn't agree on who should receive the prize due to jealousy, so they all returned to their own places without deciding. However, Themistocles was praised and considered the wisest man among the Greeks. Since he didn't receive the recognition he deserved at Salamis, he went to Lacedaemon to be honored there. The Lacedaemonians warmly welcomed him and praised him highly. They gave Eurybiades an olive crown for his excellence and another one to Themistocles for his wisdom and cleverness. They also gifted him the finest chariot in Sparta and, with many compliments, sent him home accompanied by the three hundred elite Spartan warriors called Knights, who escorted him to the borders of Tegea. Themistocles was the only person known to have received this special escort from the Spartans. 
125. When Themistocles returned to Athens from Lacedaemon, Timodemus of Aphidnae, one of his enemies but not a significant figure, was filled with jealousy. He bitterly told Themistocles that the honors he received from the Lacedaemonians were for Athens, not for him personally. Timodemus kept saying this until Themistocles responded, "The truth is, if I were from Belbina, the Spartans wouldn't have honored me like this, and neither would they have honored you, even though you're from Athens." And that was the end of that matter. 
126. Artabazus, son of Pharnaces, was already a prominent figure among the Persians and became even more so due to the events in Plataea. He escorted King Xerxes with sixty thousand chosen men from Mardonius' army to the passage leading to Asia. Once Xerxes was in Asia and Artabazus was returning near Pallene, he decided it was time to enslave the people of Potidaea, who had rebelled against the Persians. After the king had passed by the town and the Persian fleet had retreated from Salamis, Potidaea and the rest of the people in Pallene had openly revolted against the barbarians. Meanwhile, Mardonius was spending the winter in Thessaly and Macedonia, not in a hurry to join the rest of his army. 
127. Artabazus then began to attack Potidaea, and suspecting that Olynthus was also planning to rebel against the king, he attacked it as well. Olynthus was inhabited by Bottiaeans who had been forced out of the Thermaic Gulf by the Macedonians. After capturing Olynthus, Artabazus took the people to a lake, killed them, and handed over the city to Critobulus of Torone and the Chalcidian people. This is how the Chalcidians took control of Olynthus. 
128. After capturing Olynthus, Artabazus quickly turned his attention to Potidaea. He was helped by Timoxenus, the general of the Scionaeans, who agreed to betray the city. The details of their agreement are unknown, but their method of communication was quite unique. They would write letters, wrap them around an arrow's shaft, attach feathers to the letter, and shoot the arrow to a prearranged location. However, Timoxenus' plan to betray Potidaea was discovered when Artabazus accidentally shot an arrow into the shoulder of a man from Potidaea. A crowd quickly gathered around the injured man, as often happens in war, and they found the letter on the arrow. They took it to their generals and other allies from Pallene who were present. The generals read the letter and realized who the traitor was. However, they decided not to accuse Timoxenus of treason for the sake of Scione, fearing that the people of Scione would be labeled as traitors in the future. 
129. Timoxenus' betrayal was exposed in this way. Meanwhile, Artabazus had been attacking Potidaea for three months when an unusual event occurred. The sea experienced a significant low tide, turning into marshland. Seeing this, the foreign forces decided to cross the marsh to reach Pallene. However, after covering two-fifths of the distance, a massive high tide suddenly flooded the area. The locals claimed it was higher than any previous tide. Many of the foreigners who couldn't swim drowned, while those who could were killed by the Potidaeans, who attacked them in boats. The Potidaeans believed that the high tide and the Persian disaster were a result of the Persians disrespecting the temple and the statue of Poseidon located in the city's outskirts. Their explanation seems plausible. The surviving Persians were taken by Artabazus to join Mardonius in Thessaly. This is the story of the fate of the king's escort. 
130. The remaining ships of Xerxes' fleet, after escaping from Salamis and helping the king and his army cross from the Chersonese to Abydos, spent the winter in Cyme. As spring arrived, they gathered at Samos, where some of the ships had been stationed during the winter. Most of their soldiers were Persians and Medes. Mardontes, son of Bagaeus, and Artayntes, son of Artachaees, became their admirals, with Artayntes also appointing his nephew Ithamitres as a commander. However, due to their previous defeat, they didn't venture further west into the sea, nor did anyone push for it. Instead, they stayed near Samos to prevent any rebellion in Ionia. Their fleet, including Ionian and other ships, totaled 300. They didn't think the Greeks would come to Ionia, assuming they would be satisfied with defending their own land. This belief was based on the fact that the Greeks hadn't chased them after their escape from Salamis, and seemed happy to be rid of them. The Persians felt defeated at sea, but believed Mardonius would easily succeed on land. So, they stayed at Samos, planning to cause damage to their enemies and waiting for news about Mardonius' progress. 
131. As spring arrived and with Mardonius in Thessaly, the Greeks were motivated to take action. They hadn't yet assembled their army, but their fleet of 110 ships gathered in Aegina. The fleet's commander and admiral was Leutychides, son of Menares, who belonged to a long line of Spartan royalty, tracing his ancestry back to Heracles through a series of kings. However, the first seven names after Leutychides in this lineage were not kings of Sparta. The Athenian general was Xanthippus, son of Ariphron. 
132. When all the ships gathered in Aegina, messengers from the Ionians arrived at the Greek camp. These messengers had previously gone to Sparta to ask the Lacedaemonians to free Ionia. One of them was Herodotus, son of Basileides. Initially, there were seven of them who had planned to kill Strattis, the tyrant of Chios. However, when their plot was exposed, the remaining six secretly left Chios, went to Sparta, and now came to Aegina, urging the Greeks to sail to Ionia. The Greeks agreed to take them as far as Delos, but they were hesitant, as they were unfamiliar with the area and feared armed forces were everywhere. They also believed that Samos was as far away as the Pillars of Heracles. As a result, the barbarians were too discouraged to sail further west than Samos, while the Greeks, due to the Chians' request, dared not go further east than Delos. Fear kept a considerable distance between the two sides. 
133. The Greeks sailed to Delos, while Mardonius spent the winter in Thessaly. From there, he sent a man named Mys from Europus to consult various oracles. It's unclear what specific information Mardonius wanted from the oracles, as no one has mentioned it. However, it's likely that he sent Mys to inquire about his current situation and nothing else. 
134. Mys is known to have visited Lebadea and bribed a local to enter the cave of Trophonius. He also went to the oracle at Abae in Phocis. First, he went to Thebes, where he consulted the Ismenian Apollo through sacrifice, similar to the method used at Olympia. Additionally, he bribed a non-Theban to sleep in the shrine of Amphiaraus to seek a prophecy. Thebans were not allowed to do this because Amphiaraus had given them an oracle, asking them to choose between having him as a prophet or an ally. They chose him as an ally, so no Theban was permitted to sleep in that place. 
135. According to the Thebans, a surprising event occurred during Mys' journey to various oracles. He visited the temple of Ptoan Apollo, which was called Ptoum and belonged to the Thebans. The temple was located near a hill, close to Lake Copais and the town of Acraephia. When Mys entered the temple with three local men chosen to record the oracle's words, the diviner unexpectedly began speaking in a foreign language. The Thebans were shocked to hear a strange language instead of Greek and didn't understand what was happening. However, Mys quickly took the tablet from them and wrote down the oracle's words, explaining that they were in Carian. After recording everything, he returned to Thessaly. 
136. Mardonius read the messages from the oracles and decided to send a messenger, Alexander, a Macedonian and son of Amyntas, to Athens. He chose Alexander for two reasons: first, because he had a connection to the Persians through his sister Gygaea, who was married to a Persian named Bubares. Their son, Amyntas of Asia, was given a large city in Phrygia by the king. Second, Alexander was known to be a supporter and friend of the Athenians. Mardonius believed that winning over the Athenians, who were known to be numerous and brave, would be the key to gaining control of the seas. He had heard that they played a significant role in the Persians' previous naval defeats. If he could secure their alliance, he thought he would easily dominate the seas. He also believed that his land forces were much stronger, so with the Athenians on his side, he would have an advantage over the Greeks. This idea aligned with the oracles' advice to make the Athenians his allies, which is why he sent Alexander as his messenger. 
137. Alexander was a descendant of Perdiccas, who became the ruler of Macedonia through the following story. Three brothers from the Temenus family, Gauanes, Aeropus, and Perdiccas, were exiled from Argos and went to Illyria. From there, they traveled to the Macedonian highlands and arrived at the town of Lebaea. They worked as servants for the king, with one taking care of horses, another looking after oxen, and the youngest, Perdiccas, tending to smaller animals. The king's wife cooked for them, as in those days, even royal families didn't have much wealth. Whenever she baked bread, Perdiccas' loaf would double in size. She told her husband about this, and he believed it was a sign of something significant. He called the servants and told them to leave his land. They asked for their wages before leaving, and the king, in a foolish moment, pointed to the sunlight coming through the smoke vent and said that was their payment. Gauanes and Aeropus were shocked, but young Perdiccas cleverly replied, "We accept what you give, O king." He then used a knife to draw a circle around the sunlight on the floor, gathered the sunlight into his garment three times, and left with his companions. 
138. The brothers left, but someone nearby explained to the king the meaning behind the boy's actions and how he had intentionally accepted the sunlight as payment. The king became angry and sent riders to kill them. However, there was a river in the land that the descendants of these men from Argos would later honor with sacrifices for saving them. When the sons of Temenus crossed the river, it flooded, preventing the riders from following them. The brothers then settled in another part of Macedonia, near a place called Midas' garden, where roses grew naturally with sixty blossoms each and an incredible fragrance. According to Macedonian legend, Silenus was captured in this garden. Above the garden was a mountain called Bermius, which was impossible to climb due to the extreme cold. From their new home, the brothers eventually conquered the surrounding area and the rest of Macedonia. 
139. Alexander, a descendant of Perdiccas, was sent to Athens by Mardonius with a message. Mardonius told the Athenians that the king forgave their offenses and offered them their land back, more territory, and the rebuilding of their temples if they agreed to ally with him. Alexander urged the Athenians to accept the offer, as he believed they couldn't fight against Xerxes forever. However, the Lacedaemonians, fearing the Athenians might agree with the Persians, sent envoys to Athens to discourage them from making a deal with the enemy. The Athenians responded to Alexander, saying they would never make an agreement with Xerxes and would fight against him, relying on the gods and heroes' help. They asked Alexander not to bring such proposals again. To the Spartan envoys, the Athenians assured them they would never betray Greece and thanked them for their concern. They asked the Spartans to send their army quickly, as they expected the Persians to attack soon. The envoys then returned to Sparta with the Athenians' response.
