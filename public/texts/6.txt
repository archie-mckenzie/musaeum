1. Aristagoras, the one who started the Ionian revolt, met his end. Meanwhile, Histiaeus, the ruler of Miletus, came to Sardis after being released by Darius. Upon arriving from Susa, Artaphrenes, the governor of Sardis, questioned him about why he thought the Ionians had rebelled. Histiaeus claimed he didn't know and was surprised by the events, pretending to be clueless about the current situation. However, Artaphrenes saw through his lies, knowing the real story behind the revolt. He told Histiaeus, "I'll tell you the truth: you created this mess, and Aristagoras just carried it out." 
2. Artaphrenes spoke about the revolt, and his words scared Histiaeus. Fearing that Artaphrenes knew too much, Histiaeus escaped to the sea the next night. He had tricked Darius by promising to conquer Sardo, the largest island, while secretly planning to lead the Ionians in a war against Darius. Histiaeus reached Chios, where the locals captured and tied him up, thinking he was sent by Darius to cause them problems. However, once they discovered his true intentions against the king, they released him. 
3. The Ionians questioned Histiaeus about why he had encouraged Aristagoras to rebel against the king, causing significant damage to the Ionians. Instead of revealing the real reason, Histiaeus lied, saying that King Darius planned to move the Phoenicians to Ionia and the Ionians to Phoenicia. He claimed that this was why he sent the order. In reality, the king had no such plan, but Histiaeus wanted to scare the Ionians. 
4. Histiaeus sent letters to the Persians in Sardis through a messenger named Hermippus, as they had previously discussed rebelling. However, Hermippus didn't deliver the letters to the intended recipients but instead gave them to Artaphrenes. After learning about the plot, Artaphrenes instructed Hermippus to deliver Histiaeus' letters to the original recipients and bring back their responses. This exposed the conspirators, and as a result, Artaphrenes executed many Persians. 
5. Problems arose in Sardis due to Histiaeus' failed plan. He asked the Chians to take him back to Miletus, but the people there didn't want another tyrant after getting rid of Aristagoras and experiencing freedom. When Histiaeus tried to sneak into Miletus at night, a local injured his thigh, forcing him to leave his own city. He returned to Chios, but when they refused to provide him with ships, he went to Mytilene and convinced the Lesbians to give him eight ships. Histiaeus and his new allies sailed to Byzantium, where they set up camp and captured all ships leaving the Euxine Sea, unless the crews agreed to join Histiaeus' cause. 
6. Histiaeus and the Mytilenaeans were busy with their actions, while a large fleet and army were heading towards Miletus. The Persian generals had combined their forces and focused on attacking Miletus, paying less attention to other strongholds. The Phoenicians were particularly enthusiastic about fighting, and they were joined by the recently conquered Cyprians, as well as the Cilicians and Egyptians. 
7. The Ionians learned that their enemies were coming to attack Miletus and the rest of Ionia. They sent representatives to the Panionium to discuss their strategy. After deliberating, they decided not to gather a land army to face the Persians. Instead, they would let the Milesians defend their city walls while they prepared their entire fleet for a naval battle. They planned to assemble quickly at Lade, a small island near Miletus, to fight for their city at sea. 
8. The Ionians gathered their ships, along with the Aeolians from Lesbos, and prepared for battle. Their formation was as follows: The Milesians held the eastern wing with 80 ships, followed by the Prieneans with 12 ships, the Myesians with 3 ships, the Teians with 17 ships, the Chians with 100 ships, the Erythraeans with 8 ships, the Phocaeans with 3 ships, the Lesbians with 70 ships, and finally, the Samians held the western wing with 60 ships. In total, they had 353 triremes ready for battle. 
9. The Ionians had their ships ready, while the foreigners had 600 ships. When the Persian generals saw the Ionian fleet, they worried that they might be too weak to defeat the Greeks. They knew that if they couldn't control the sea, they wouldn't be able to capture Miletus and would face punishment from Darius. So, they gathered the former Ionian rulers who had been overthrown by Aristagoras of Miletus and had fled to the Medes. These rulers were now part of the army attacking Miletus. The Persian generals told these former rulers to prove their loyalty to the king by convincing their fellow Ionians to separate from the rest of the Greek forces. They were to promise that if the Ionians surrendered, they wouldn't be harmed, their temples and homes wouldn't be destroyed, and they wouldn't be treated more harshly than before. However, if the Ionians refused and chose to fight, they should be threatened with severe consequences. If defeated, they would be enslaved, their boys would be made eunuchs, their girls would be taken captive to Bactra, and their land would be given to others. 
10. The Ionian rulers followed the Persian generals' instructions and sent messages to their fellow countrymen during the night. However, the Ionians who received these messages were determined not to betray their allies. They believed that the Persians had made this offer only to them. This took place right after the Persians arrived at Miletus. 
11. At a meeting held by the Ionians on Lade, one of the speakers was Dionysius, the Phocaean general, who said: "Fellow Ionians, our fate hangs in the balance, as we stand between freedom and slavery. If you are willing to endure hardships now, we can defeat our enemies and secure our freedom. But if you choose to be weak and disorganized, I don't see how we can avoid punishment from the king for our rebellion. Trust me and follow my lead; I assure you that if the gods are on our side, our enemies will either not dare to face us or will be completely defeated if they do." 
12. When the Ionians heard Dionysius' words, they decided to follow his lead. Every day, he led them out to sea with their ships, practicing maneuvers and preparing the soldiers on board for battle. They would anchor the fleet for the rest of the day, keeping the Ionians busy with work. For seven days, they followed his orders, but on the eighth day, exhausted from the hard labor and the hot sun, they began to complain to one another: "What have we done to anger the gods that we must endure this hardship? We must have lost our minds to put ourselves in the hands of this boastful Phocaean, who only brought three ships. Now that he has us, he's making our lives miserable. Many of us are already sick, and more will likely fall ill. It would be better to face whatever form of slavery awaits us than to continue suffering like this. Let's stop following his orders!" From that point on, the Ionians refused to obey Dionysius. They set up tents on the island where they were staying, seeking shade and rest. They no longer wanted to go out on their ships or continue their training exercises. 
13. When the Samian generals saw the Ionians' disorganization, they remembered the message they had received from Aeaces, the son of Syloson, who had urged them to abandon the Ionian alliance on behalf of the Persians. Realizing the difficulty of defeating the king's forces and knowing that if they managed to defeat Darius' current fleet, an even larger one would follow, the Samians decided to accept the message. They believed it would be better to save their temples and homes, especially since the Ionians were not being helpful. Aeaces, who had sent the message, was the son of Syloson and the grandson of Aeaces. He had been the ruler of Samos until he was overthrown by Aristagoras of Miletus, just like the other Ionian rulers. 
14. As the Phoenician fleet approached, the Ionians sailed out to face them in a battle formation. It's difficult to say which Ionians were brave or cowardly during the fight, as they all blamed each other. The Samians, following their agreement with Aeaces, are said to have raised their sails and retreated to Samos, abandoning their position. However, eleven Samian ships remained and fought, defying their commanders' orders. In recognition of their bravery, the Samian people had the names of these captains and their ancestors engraved on a pillar, which now stands in the marketplace. Seeing the Samians flee, the Lesbians followed suit, as did most of the other Ionians. 
15. Among those who stayed and fought in the sea battle, the Chians faced the toughest challenge. They refused to act cowardly and performed remarkable deeds. They had contributed a hundred ships to the fleet, each carrying forty elite citizens. Despite being abandoned by most of their allies, they believed it was not right to behave like the weakest among them. With only a few allies to support them, they continued to fight, breaking through the enemy's line. In the process, they captured many enemy ships but lost most of their own. 
16. The Chians managed to return to their homeland with their remaining ships. However, the crews of the damaged Chian ships were chased and sought refuge in Mykale. They abandoned their ships there and started traveling across the mainland on foot. During their journey, they entered the lands of Ephesus at night, while the women were celebrating the Thesmophoria festival. The Ephesians, unaware of the Chians' situation and seeing an army invading their land, believed they were robbers targeting their women. As a result, they gathered their forces and killed the Chians. 
17. When Dionysius the Phocaean realized that the Ionian cause was lost, he didn't return to Phocaea with the three enemy ships he had captured, knowing that it would be enslaved along with the rest of Ionia. Instead, he immediately sailed to Phoenicia, where he sank some merchant ships and acquired a large sum of money. Afterward, he sailed to Sicily and became a pirate, targeting Carthaginians and Tyrrhenians, but never attacking Greeks. 
18. After the Persians defeated the Ionians at sea, they besieged Miletus from both land and sea. They used various tactics, including tunneling under the walls, until they finally captured the city in the sixth year following Aristagoras' revolt. The people of Miletus were enslaved, fulfilling the prophecy that had been foretold about the city's tragic fate. 
19. When the people of Argos asked the oracle at Delphi about their city's safety, they received a response that included a message for the Milesians as well. I will discuss the part concerning the Argives later in my account, but the prophecy for the absent Milesians was as follows: "Miletus, you who plot evil deeds, you will become a feast and source of great gifts for many. Your wives will wash the feet of numerous long-haired men, and others will serve my Didyman shrine." This prophecy came true for the Milesians, as most of their men were killed by the long-haired Persians. Their women and children were enslaved, and the temple at Didyma, along with its shrine and oracle, was looted and burned. I have mentioned the riches that were in this temple several times throughout my writings. 
20. Following their capture, the Milesians were taken to Susa. King Darius didn't harm them any further and instead settled them near the Red Sea, in the city of Ampe, which is located by the Tigris River as it flows into the sea. The Persians took control of the land closest to the city and the plains, while the hilly regions were given to the Carians from Pedasa. 
21. When the Milesians faced hardships at the hands of the Persians, the Sybarites, who had lost their city and were living in Laus and Scidrus, did not repay the kindness the Milesians had shown them. When Sybaris was captured by the Crotoniates, the people of Miletus, both young and old, shaved their heads and mourned publicly. No other cities were known to have such a close friendship. The Athenians, on the other hand, showed their deep sorrow for the fall of Miletus in various ways. One notable example was when Phrynichus wrote and staged a play called "The Fall of Miletus." The entire audience was moved to tears. The Athenians fined Phrynichus a thousand drachmas for reminding them of such a painful event and banned the play from ever being performed again. 
22. Miletus was left without its people, the Milesians. The wealthy Samians were unhappy with their generals' actions involving the Medes. So, after the sea battle, they decided to leave their country before the tyrant Aeaces arrived, preferring to establish a colony elsewhere rather than live as slaves under the Medes and Aeaces. Around this time, the people of Zancle in Sicily sent messengers to Ionia, inviting the Ionians to establish a city on the Fair Coast, a beautiful area in Sicily facing Tyrrhenia. In response to this invitation, only the Samians and the surviving Milesians set out to join the Ionians. 
23. During their journey to Sicily, the Samians experienced an unexpected event. While traveling, they arrived in the land of the Epizephyrian Locrians just as the people of Zancle and their king, Scythes, were trying to capture a Sicilian town. Anaxilaus, the ruler of Rhegium, who was in conflict with the Zanclaeans, joined forces with the Samians. He convinced them to abandon their trip to the Fair Coast and instead seize Zancle while its people were away. The Samians agreed and took control of Zancle. When the Zanclaeans found out their city had been captured, they sought help from their ally, Hippocrates, the ruler of Gela. However, instead of helping them, Hippocrates imprisoned Scythes and his brother Pythogenes for losing the city and sent them to the city of Inyx. He then betrayed the rest of the Zanclaeans to the Samians, with whom he had made a secret agreement and exchanged oaths. The Samians agreed to give Hippocrates half of the movable goods and slaves in the city, as well as everything in the surrounding countryside. Hippocrates enslaved most of the Zanclaeans, and he handed over three hundred of their leaders to the Samians to be executed. However, the Samians chose not to kill them. 
24. Scythes, the king of Zancle, managed to escape from Inyx to Himera, and from there, he traveled to Asia to meet King Darius. Darius saw Scythes as the most honest man among all the Greeks who had come to visit him. With the king's permission, Scythes returned to Sicily and later went back to Darius. He eventually spent his old age in Persia, living a wealthy life. Meanwhile, the Samians easily settled in the beautiful city of Zancle, having escaped from the Medes. 
25. After the sea battle for Miletus, the Phoenicians, following the Persians' orders, brought Aeaces, the son of Syloson, back to Samos. This was due to his valuable service and impressive accomplishments. Since the Samians had abandoned their ships during the sea battle, they were the only rebel group whose city and temples were not burned down. Once Miletus was captured, the Persians quickly took control of Caria. Some towns willingly surrendered, while others were conquered by force. 
26. This is what happened: Histiaeus, a Milesian, was in Byzantium, intercepting Ionian merchant ships as they left the Black Sea. When he heard about the situation in Miletus, he left the affairs of the Hellespont to Bisaltes of Abydos, the son of Apollophanes, and sailed with the Lesbians to Chios. When the Chian guard ships refused to let him in, he fought in an area called the Hollows of Chios. He killed many of their crew members. The rest of the local people, weakened by the sea battle, were defeated by Histiaeus and his Lesbians, who launched their attack from Polichne in Chios. 
27. When great disasters threaten cities or nations, it's common for warning signs to appear. The Chians had received such signs before all this happened. They had sent a group of a hundred young men to Delphi, but only two returned, as the other ninety-eight were taken away by a deadly disease. Around the same time, just before the sea battle, the roof of a school collapsed on children learning to read, and out of one hundred and twenty students, only one survived. These signs were shown to them by a god. Then the sea battle struck, bringing the city to its knees, followed by Histiaeus and the Lesbians. With the Chians in such a terrible situation, it was easy for him to conquer them. 
28. Histiaeus gathered a large army of Ionians and Aeolians and attacked Thasos. While he was besieging the city, he received news that the Phoenicians were leaving Miletus to attack the rest of Ionia. Upon hearing this, he abandoned the siege of Thasos and quickly led his army to Lesbos. Since his troops were hungry, he decided to cross over to Atarneus to gather corn from there and from the Mysian fields in the Caicus plain. By chance, Harpagus, a Persian, was in the area with a significant force. When Histiaeus arrived, Harpagus confronted him in battle, capturing Histiaeus alive and killing most of his soldiers. 
29. Histiaeus was captured in the following manner: The Greeks and Persians fought a long battle at Malene in the region of Atarneus. Eventually, the Persian cavalry charged and attacked the Greeks. As a result, the Greeks were defeated. Believing that the king would not execute him for his current actions, Histiaeus desperately tried to save his life. While fleeing, a Persian soldier caught up to him and was about to stab him. Histiaeus quickly shouted in Persian, revealing his identity as Histiaeus the Milesian. 
30. If Histiaeus had been captured and brought to King Darius, he likely would not have been harmed, and the king might have forgiven him. However, when Histiaeus was taken to Sardis, Artaphrenes, the governor, and Harpagus, the man who captured him, were worried that he might escape and regain power at the court. So, they decided to impale his body and send his embalmed head to King Darius in Susa. Upon hearing this, King Darius was upset that Histiaeus had not been brought to him alive. He ordered that the head be washed and buried with proper ceremony, as a tribute to a man who had greatly benefited both Darius and Persia. 
31. This is what happened to Histiaeus. The Persian fleet spent the winter at Miletus and, in the following year, easily conquered the nearby islands of Chios, Lesbos, and Tenedos. When the Persians captured an island, they would round up the people using a unique method: the soldiers would join hands, forming a line that stretched from the northern sea to the southern sea, and then they would move across the entire island, capturing the inhabitants. They also took control of the Ionian cities on the mainland, but they couldn't use the same method to round up the people there, as it wasn't possible. 
32. The Persian generals kept their promises to the Ionians when they had camped opposite them. After conquering the cities, they selected the most attractive boys and castrated them, turning them into eunuchs. They also took the most beautiful girls to the king. In addition to this, they burned the cities along with their temples. This marked the third time the Ionians had been enslaved: once by the Lydians and twice consecutively by the Persians. 
33. The fleet then left Ionia and captured everything on the left side of the Hellespont, while the Persians had already conquered the right side from the mainland. The European regions near the Hellespont included the Chersonese, which had many cities, Perinthus, the forts towards Thrace, Selymbria, and Byzantium. The people of Byzantium and Calchedon didn't wait for the Phoenicians to attack; they left their land and fled to the Euxine, settling in the city of Mesambria. The Phoenicians burned the mentioned places and attacked Proconnesus and Artace, setting them on fire as well. They then returned to the Chersonese to destroy the remaining cities they hadn't attacked earlier. However, they didn't attack Cyzicus at all, because the people of Cyzicus had already agreed to become subjects of the king before the Phoenician expedition. They made this agreement with the governor of Dascyleum, Oebares, the son of Megabazus. 
34. The Phoenicians conquered all the cities in the Chersonese except for Cardia, where Miltiades, the son of Cimon and grandson of Stesagoras, was the ruler. Miltiades, the son of Cypselus, had gained control earlier in this way: the Thracian Dolonci people lived in the Chersonese and were defeated in war by the Apsinthians. So, the Dolonci kings went to Delphi to ask for advice about the war. The oracle told them to bring to their land the first person who offered them hospitality after they left the sacred area. As the Dolonci traveled through Phocis and Boeotia along the Sacred Way, no one invited them in. So, they headed towards Athens. 
35. At that time in Athens, Pisistratus held all the power, but Miltiades, the son of Cypselus, was also very influential. He came from a wealthy family that could afford a four-horse chariot, and his earliest ancestors were from Aeacus and Aegina, while his more recent family was Athenian. Philaeus, the son of Ajax, was the first from that family to become an Athenian. One day, Miltiades was sitting on his porch when he saw the Dolonci people walking by, wearing foreign clothes and carrying spears. He called out to them and invited them in for lodging and hospitality. They accepted his offer, and after he entertained them, they told him the whole story of the oracle and asked him to follow the god's advice. Miltiades was easily convinced because he was tired of living under Pisistratus' rule and wanted to get away from it. So, he immediately went to Delphi to ask the oracle if he should do what the Dolonci requested. 
36. The oracle also told Miltiades to go ahead with the plan. So, Miltiades, the son of Cypselus and a previous Olympic winner in the four-horse chariot race, gathered any Athenians who wanted to join the expedition. They sailed with the Dolonci and took control of their land. The people who brought him there made him the ruler. Miltiades' first action was to build a wall across the narrow strip of land connecting the Chersonese to the city of Cardia and Pactye. This was done to protect the people from the Apsinthians, who might invade their land. The narrow strip of land was 36 stadia wide, and the Chersonese region extended 420 stadia to the south of this strip. 
37. After Miltiades protected the Chersonese by building a wall, he started a war against the people of Lampsacus. However, the Lampsacenes set a trap and captured him. Miltiades was highly regarded by Croesus, the king of Lydia, who heard about his capture. Croesus sent a message to the Lampsacenes, ordering them to release Miltiades. He threatened that if they didn't, he would destroy them like a pine tree. The Lampsacenes were confused about what Croesus meant by comparing their destruction to a pine tree. Finally, one of the elders understood the meaning: a pine tree is the only tree that, once cut down, never grows back; it is completely destroyed. Fearing Croesus' threat, the Lampsacenes released Miltiades and let him go. 
38. Miltiades was saved by Croesus' intervention, but he later died without any children. His rule and possessions were passed on to Stesagoras, the son of his half-brother Cimon. After Miltiades' death, the people of the Chersonese honored him as their founder by offering sacrifices and organizing horse races and gymnastic competitions. However, no one from Lampsacus was allowed to participate. Stesagoras also met a tragic end during the war against the Lampsacenes. He died without any children after being struck on the head with an axe in the town hall. The attacker pretended to be a deserter but was actually an enemy and a violent man. 
39. Stesagoras died in this manner. The sons of Pisistratus sent Miltiades, son of Cimon and brother of the deceased Stesagoras, to the Chersonese in a ship to take control of the region. They had treated him well in Athens, pretending they were not involved in the death of his father, Cimon, which I will discuss later. Upon arriving in the Chersonese, Miltiades stayed inside his house, claiming to honor his brother Stesagoras' memory. When the people of the Chersonese heard this, their leaders gathered from all the cities to show support for his mourning. However, Miltiades captured them. In this way, Miltiades took control of the Chersonese. He maintained a guard of 500 men and married Hegesipyle, the daughter of Olorus, the king of Thrace. 
40. Not long after Miltiades, son of Cimon, arrived in the Chersonese, he faced even greater challenges than before. Three years earlier, he had been forced to leave the region due to an invasion by the Scythians. These nomadic Scythians, angered by Darius, joined forces and advanced towards the Chersonese. Miltiades didn't wait for their attack and fled the area. Eventually, the Scythians left, and the Dolonci people brought Miltiades back to the Chersonese. All of this had happened three years before the events that currently concerned him. 
41. Upon learning that the Phoenicians were in Tenedos, Miltiades decided to sail to Athens with five ships filled with his belongings. He left from Cardia and crossed the Black Bay, but while sailing along the Chersonese, the Phoenicians attacked him with their ships. Miltiades managed to escape with four of his ships to Imbros, but the fifth one was caught by the Phoenicians. The captain of the captured ship was Metiochus, Miltiades' eldest son from a different wife, not the daughter of Olorus, the Thracian king. The Phoenicians took Metiochus as a prisoner and, knowing he was Miltiades' son, brought him to King Darius. They thought this would please the king since Miltiades had previously suggested that the Ionians should obey the Scythians' demand to destroy the bridge of boats and return to their homes. However, Darius didn't harm Metiochus; instead, he treated him well, giving him a house, possessions, and a Persian wife. This wife bore him children who were considered Persians. Meanwhile, Miltiades safely reached Athens from Imbros. 
42. During that year, the Persians didn't cause any more problems for the Ionians, and some events occurred that greatly benefited them. Artaphrenes, the governor of Sardis, called for representatives from the cities and made the Ionians agree to follow the law and not steal or loot from each other. He enforced this agreement and measured their lands using parasangs, a Persian unit of distance equal to thirty stadia. Based on this measurement, he set a fixed tribute for each city, which has remained the same since then. The amount was similar to what they had paid before. This agreement helped maintain peace among the Ionians. 
43. As spring began, the king replaced the other generals with Mardonius, son of Gobryas, a young man who had recently married Darius' daughter, Artozostre. Mardonius led a massive army and fleet to the coast. When he reached Cilicia with his army, he boarded a ship and sailed with the rest of his fleet, while other captains led the land army towards the Hellespont. During Mardonius' journey along the coast of Asia, he did something that would surprise those Greeks who didn't believe Otanes had argued for democracy in Persia: Mardonius removed all the Ionian tyrants and established democracies in their cities. After doing this, he quickly headed to the Hellespont. With a large number of ships and a vast army gathered, the Persians crossed the Hellespont by sea and marched through Europe, aiming for Eretria and Athens. 
44. The main goal of their expedition was to conquer as many Greek cities as possible. Their fleet easily took control of Thasos, as the people didn't even try to resist. Meanwhile, their land army enslaved the Macedonians, adding them to their existing subjects, as all the nations closer to them than Macedonia had already been conquered by the Persians. After crossing from Thasos, they traveled near the land up to Acanthus and then attempted to sail around Athos. However, a strong and unstoppable north wind struck them, causing great damage and driving many of their ships onto the shores of Athos. It is said that around 300 ships were lost, and more than 20,000 men died. Some men were killed by wild beasts along the coast of Athos, others were crushed against the rocks, some drowned because they couldn't swim, and others died from the cold. 
45. The fleet faced many challenges, and Mardonius and his land army also encountered difficulties. While they were camped in Macedonia, the Brygi of Thrace launched a night attack, killing many soldiers and injuring Mardonius himself. However, the Persians eventually enslaved the Brygi, and Mardonius didn't leave the area until he had conquered them. After their victory, Mardonius led his army back towards home. His forces had suffered significant losses from the Brygi's attack and even more from the disaster at Athos involving his fleet. With these setbacks, the expedition returned to Asia without much glory. 
46. The following year, Darius sent a message to the Thasians, who were rumored to be planning a rebellion. He ordered them to tear down their walls and bring their ships to Abdera. The Thasians had previously been under siege by Histiaeus of Miletus, and they used their wealth to build warships and stronger walls. Their income came from both the mainland and their mines. On average, they received about eighty talents from the gold mines in the "Dug Forest" and a smaller amount from the mines on Thasos itself. This income allowed the Thasians to avoid paying taxes on their crops and still collect an average annual revenue of two hundred talents, or even three hundred talents during their most profitable years. 
47. I have personally seen these mines. The most impressive ones were discovered by the Phoenicians who, along with Thasos, colonized this island, which is now named after the Phoenician Thasos. These Phoenician mines are located between the areas called Aenyra and Coenyra in Thasos, across from Samothrace. They are in a large hill that has been excavated during the search. That's all about the mines. Following the king's orders, the Thasians tore down their walls and brought all their ships to Abdera. 
48. Darius wanted to find out if the Greeks planned to fight against him or surrender. So, he sent messengers all over Greece, asking them to request a gift of earth and water for the king as a sign of submission. He also sent some messengers to the coastal cities under his control, ordering them to build warships and horse transports. 
49. The cities began preparing as instructed. The messengers who went to Greece received the demanded gifts of earth and water from many people on the mainland and from all the islanders they approached. Among the islanders who gave these gifts to Darius were the Aeginetans. The Athenians, believing that the Aeginetans did this out of hostility towards Athens and to join forces with the Persians against them, quickly seized this opportunity. They went to Sparta and accused the Aeginetans of betraying Greece. 
50. In response to the accusation, Cleomenes, the son of Anaxandrides and king of Sparta, went to Aegina to arrest those responsible. However, when he tried to make the arrests, the Aeginetans resisted, particularly Crius, the son of Polycritus. Crius told Cleomenes that he wouldn't be able to arrest any Aeginetan without consequences, as he didn't have the Spartans' approval for his actions. Crius accused Cleomenes of being bribed by the Athenians, and said that if he had the proper authority, he would have come with the other king. This statement was influenced by a letter from Demaratus. Being forced to leave Aegina, Cleomenes asked Crius for his name. When Crius told him, Cleomenes replied, "Now is the time to put bronze on your horns, Mr. Ram, for great trouble will come your way." 
51. During this time, Demaratus, the son of Ariston, stayed in Sparta and spread negative rumors about Cleomenes. Demaratus was also a king of Sparta, but from a less prestigious family. Although both families shared a common ancestor, the family of Eurysthenes held slightly higher honor due to their status as the firstborn. 
52. The people of Sparta claim that it was Aristodemus, not his sons, who led them to the land they now inhabit. Aristodemus' wife, Argeia, gave birth to twin boys. Aristodemus saw his children but soon after died from an illness. The Spartans wanted to follow their tradition and make the eldest child king, but they couldn't tell the twins apart. Even their mother claimed not to know which one was older, hoping that both could become kings. Confused, the Spartans consulted the oracle at Delphi. The priestess advised them to make both children kings but give more honor to the elder one. Still unsure how to identify the older twin, a man from Messenia named Panites suggested observing the mother to see which child she fed and washed first. If she consistently favored one child, they would know which one was older. The Spartans followed Panites' advice and noticed that the mother always tended to one child before the other, unaware that she was being observed. They assumed this child was the elder and raised him as the first-born, naming him Eurysthenes, while the other was named Procles. As the brothers grew up, they constantly fought with each other, and this rivalry continued among their descendants. 
53. The people of Sparta are the only Greeks who tell this story. However, in my writing, I rely on the general Greek account, which traces the lineage of the Dorian kings back to Perseus, the son of Danae. They don't mention any gods in their lineage, proving that these kings were Greek. I stopped at Perseus because no mortal father is named for him, unlike Amphitryon, who is named as the father of Heracles. So, it's reasonable to say that the Greek account is accurate up to Perseus. If we go further back and consider the ancestors of each king, starting with Danae, the daughter of Acrisius, then the Dorian leaders would be considered true-born Egyptians. 
54. According to the Greek version, I have traced their ancestry, but the Persian story claims that Perseus was originally an Assyrian who later became Greek, unlike his ancestors. The Persians also believe that Acrisius' ancestors were not related to Perseus and, as the Greeks agree, they were Egyptians. 
55. I've said enough about this topic. The reasons and accomplishments that led these Egyptians to become kings of the Dorians have already been discussed by others, so I won't go into that. Instead, I'll focus on aspects that haven't been covered yet. 
56. The Spartans have granted their kings the following privileges: they hold two religious positions, one for Zeus Lacedaemon and another for Zeus of Heaven. They can wage war against any land they choose, and no Spartan can stop them without facing a curse. When the army marches, the kings lead the way and return last. A hundred selected men protect them during battles. They can sacrifice as many sheep and goats as they want before their expeditions, and they take the hides and backs of all the sacrificed animals. 
57. The kings have certain rights during peacetime as well. At public feasts, they sit and eat first, receiving double the portion of everyone else. They also make the first offerings and get the hides of the sacrificed animals. Each month, they receive a full-grown animal for sacrifice, a bushel of barley-meal, and a Laconian quart of wine from the public store. They have reserved seats at games and can appoint citizens as protectors of foreigners. Each king chooses two Pythians, who are ambassadors to Delphi and dine with the kings at public expense. If the kings don't attend public dinners, they receive a portion of barley-meal and wine at home. When they do attend, they get double shares of everything, and the same applies when invited to private dinners. They keep all the oracles, although the Pythians also know them. The kings alone judge cases involving unwedded heiresses and public roads. If someone wants to adopt a child, it's done in the kings' presence. The kings sit with the twenty-eight elders in council meetings. If they're absent, their closest relatives hold the king's voting rights, giving two extra votes in addition to their own. 
58. The kings receive certain privileges from the Spartan community while they are alive. When they die, the following customs take place: Horsemen announce their death throughout Laconia, and women in the city beat on cauldrons. Two people from each household, a man and a woman, must wear mourning clothes, facing severe penalties if they don't. The Lacedaemonians share this custom with some foreign cultures in Asia. When a Spartan king dies, a specific number of people from neighboring regions, along with the Spartans, must attend the funeral. With thousands of helots, Spartans, and women gathered, they passionately hit their foreheads and loudly mourn, praising the recently deceased king as the best of all kings. If a king dies in battle, they create a statue of him and carry it on a decorated stretcher. For ten days after the burial, there are no meetings or elections, and the people continue to mourn. 
59. The Lacedaemonians have a practice similar to the Persians: when a king dies and a new one takes over, the successor cancels any debts owed by Spartans to the king or the community. Similarly, among the Persians, the king forgives all cities for any unpaid tribute at the start of his reign. 
60. The Lacedaemonians have a similarity with the Egyptians in that their heralds, flute-players, and cooks inherit their professions from their parents. A flute-player's child becomes a flute-player, a cook's child becomes a cook, and a herald's child becomes a herald. No one else can take their positions just by having a loud voice or other skills; they practice their craft by birthright. That's how things work in their society. 
61. While Cleomenes was in Aegina working for the greater good of Hellas, Demaratus spread rumors about him, not out of concern for the Aeginetans, but out of jealousy and envy. When Cleomenes returned home from Aegina, he planned to remove Demaratus from his kingship, using a past incident as an excuse against him: Ariston, the king of Sparta, had been married twice but had no children. He didn't believe he was the reason, so he married a third time. This is how it happened: Ariston had a close friend in Sparta, whose wife was the most beautiful woman in the city. However, she had once been the ugliest. Her nurse, concerned about her unattractive appearance and her wealthy background, decided to take the child to the sacred area of Helen, located in a place called Therapne, beyond the sacred area of Phoebus. The nurse would bring the child there every day, placing her beside the statue and praying to the goddess to free the child from her ugliness. One day, as they were leaving the sacred area, a woman appeared and asked the nurse what she was carrying in her arms. The nurse replied that it was a child, but she couldn't show her because the parents had forbidden it. The woman insisted, and when the nurse saw how important it was to her, she showed her the child. The woman gently touched the child's head and said she would become the most beautiful woman in all of Sparta. From that day on, her appearance changed, and when she was of marriageable age, Agetus, the son of Alcidas, married her. Agetus was Ariston's friend. 
62. Ariston fell in love with this woman and came up with a plan. He promised his friend Agetus that he would give him anything he wanted from his possessions, and asked Agetus to do the same for him. Agetus, not worried about his wife since Ariston was already married, agreed and they both swore an oath. Ariston gave Agetus whatever he chose from his belongings, and then, seeking an equal exchange, tried to take Agetus' wife. Agetus argued that he hadn't agreed to that, but due to his oath and the cunning scheme, he was forced to let his wife be taken by Ariston. 
63. Ariston married his third wife after divorcing his second one. However, his new wife gave birth to Demaratus too early, before ten lunar months had passed. When a servant informed Ariston, who was sitting with the ephors, that he had a son, Ariston calculated the months since the marriage and swore, "It's not mine." The ephors heard this but didn't make a big deal out of it. As the boy grew up, Ariston regretted saying that because he truly believed Demaratus was his son. He named him Demaratus because before his birth, all the people of Sparta had prayed for Ariston, the most respected king, to have a son. So, Demaratus' name means "answer to the people's prayer." 
64. As time went by, Ariston passed away, and Demaratus became the king. However, it seemed that these past events were destined to be revealed and lead to Demaratus losing his throne. He had already had a disagreement with Cleomenes when he brought the army back from Eleusis, and their relationship worsened when Cleomenes went after the Aeginetans who were siding with the Medes. 
65. Cleomenes wanted revenge, so he made an agreement with Leotychides, who was from the same family as Demaratus. The agreement was that Leotychides would support Cleomenes against the Aeginetans if he became king. Leotychides already had a strong grudge against Demaratus because Demaratus had stolen his fiancée, Percalus, and married her first. This made Leotychides hostile towards Demaratus. At Cleomenes' urging, Leotychides swore an oath against Demaratus, claiming that he wasn't the rightful king of the Spartans since he wasn't Ariston's son. Leotychides then took legal action against Demaratus, reminding everyone of Ariston's statement when he was told he had a son, how he had counted the months and sworn the child wasn't his. Leotychides used this statement to argue that Demaratus wasn't Ariston's son and therefore wasn't the rightful king of Sparta. He brought in the ephors who had been present when Ariston made the statement as witnesses. 
66. Arguments broke out over the issue, so the Spartans decided to ask the oracle at Delphi if Demaratus was truly Ariston's son. Cleomenes influenced this decision. He had gained the support of a powerful Delphian, Cobon, who convinced the priestess, Periallus, to say what Cleomenes wanted. When the ambassadors asked if Demaratus was Ariston's son, the Pythia declared that he was not. Later on, the truth came out. Cobon was exiled from Delphi, and Periallus lost her position as priestess. 
67. Demaratus lost his kingship, and he eventually went into exile among the Medes due to an insult. After being removed from the throne, he was elected to a different position. During the Gymnopaidia festival, Leotychides, who had become king in his place, saw Demaratus in the audience and decided to mock him. He sent a messenger to ask Demaratus how it felt to hold a lower position after being a king. Demaratus was hurt by the question and replied that he had experienced both roles, while Leotychides had not. He added that this question would mark the beginning of either great misfortune or great luck for Sparta. After saying this, Demaratus covered his head, left the theater, and went home. He immediately made preparations and offered a sacrifice to Zeus by killing an ox. Then, he called for his mother. 
68. When his mother arrived, Demaratus placed some of the animal entrails in her hands and pleaded with her, saying, "Mother, I call upon Zeus and all the other gods to ask you to tell me the truth. Who is my real father? Please be honest with me. Leotychides claimed during our arguments that you were already pregnant by your former husband when you married Ariston. Others have made even more ridiculous claims, saying that you were involved with one of the servants, the ass-keeper, and that I am his son. I beg you, by the gods, to tell me the truth. If you have done any of what they say, you are not alone; many other women have done the same. There are rumors in Sparta that Ariston was unable to father children, or else his previous wives would have given him offspring." 
69. Demaratus' mother replied, "My son, since you beg me to tell the truth, I will reveal everything to you. On the third night after Ariston brought me to his house, a ghost that looked like him came to me. It slept with me and then placed garlands on me before leaving. Later, when Ariston saw me wearing the garlands, he asked who gave them to me. I said he did, but he denied it. I swore that he had come to me just a short while ago, slept with me, and given me the garlands. I told him it wasn't right for him to deny it. When he saw me swearing, he realized that this was a divine event. The garlands had clearly come from the hero's shrine near the courtyard doors, which they call Astrabacus' precinct. The seers confirmed that this hero was the one who visited me. So, my son, you now have the information you wanted. Either you are the son of this hero, Astrabacus, or Ariston is your father, as I became pregnant that night. Regarding the main accusation from your enemies, that Ariston denied you were his child in front of many people because the ten months hadn't passed, he simply didn't understand how pregnancies work. Some women give birth after nine or even seven months, not all pregnancies last ten months. I gave birth to you after seven months. Later, Ariston realized that he had made a foolish mistake in saying that. Don't believe any other stories about your birth. You have heard the whole truth. I hope that Leotychides' wife and the wives of those who spread these rumors give birth to children fathered by ass-keepers." 
70. Demaratus' mother finished speaking, and he got the answers he wanted. He then gathered supplies and set off for Elis, pretending he was going to Delphi to consult the oracle. However, the Lacedaemonians suspected he was trying to escape and chased after him. Demaratus managed to reach Zacynthus from Elis before they caught up to him. The Lacedaemonians followed him there and tried to capture him, taking his servants instead. The people of Zacynthus refused to hand him over, and later, Demaratus traveled from there to Asia, where he met King Darius. Darius welcomed Demaratus warmly and gave him lands and cities. Demaratus had reached Asia through a series of events, having gained much fame in Lacedaemon for his many accomplishments and wisdom. He had also brought victory to the state by winning a chariot race at Olympia, making him the only Spartan king to achieve this. 
71. After Demaratus was removed from power, Leutychides, the son of Menares, became the king. He had a son named Zeuxidemus, who was also called Cyniscus by some Spartans. However, Zeuxidemus never became the king of Sparta because he died before Leutychides, leaving behind his son, Archidemus. After Zeuxidemus' death, Leutychides married a second wife, Eurydame, who was the sister of Menius and the daughter of Diactorides. They didn't have any sons together, but they had a daughter named Lampito. Leutychides arranged for Lampito to marry Archidemus, the son of Zeuxidemus. 
72. Leutychides didn't live to be old in Sparta either, as he faced punishment for his actions against Demaratus. He led a Lacedaemonian army to Thessaly, and even though he could have conquered the entire region, he accepted a large bribe instead. He was caught red-handed with a sleeve full of silver in the camp, and as a result, he was put on trial and exiled from Sparta. His house was also destroyed. Leutychides eventually settled in Tegea, where he died. 
73. This event took place much later. After Cleomenes successfully dealt with Demaratus, he quickly took Leutychides with him to punish the Aeginetans, who had angered him with their insulting behavior. Seeing both kings coming after them, the Aeginetans decided not to resist any further. The kings then selected ten of the most respected and wealthy men from Aegina, including Crius, the son of Polycritus, and Casambus, the son of Aristocrates, who were the two most influential men in Aegina. They took these men to Attica and handed them over to the Athenians, who were the Aeginetans' worst enemies. 
74. Later on, Cleomenes' deceitful plan against Demaratus was exposed. Fearing the Spartans' reaction, he secretly fled to Thessaly. From there, he went to Arcadia and caused chaos, uniting the Arcadians against Sparta. One of his tactics to ensure their loyalty was to bring the leading men of Arcadia to the city of Nonacris and make them swear an oath by the water of the Styx. The Styx, a sacred water source in Arcadia, is said to be located near Nonacris. It appears as a small stream, falling from a cliff into a pool surrounded by a stone wall. Nonacris, where this spring originates, is an Arcadian city close to Pheneus. 
75. When the Lacedaemonians found out what Cleomenes was doing, they became scared and brought him back to Sparta to rule as before. Cleomenes had already been somewhat unstable, and after returning from exile, he became even more mentally disturbed. He would randomly hit any Spartan he met in the face with his staff. Due to his violent behavior and insanity, his relatives restrained him in stocks. While in the stocks, Cleomenes asked his guard for a dagger. At first, the guard, who was a helot, refused, but Cleomenes threatened him with consequences once he was free. Fearing the threats, the guard gave him the dagger. Cleomenes then used the weapon to cut himself, starting from his shins and working his way up to his belly, slicing his flesh into strips. He eventually died from these self-inflicted wounds. Most Greeks believe Cleomenes died because he had convinced the Pythian priestess to spread the story about Demaratus. However, the Athenians claim it was because he attacked Eleusis and destroyed the gods' sanctuary. The Argives argue that it was because he killed Argives who had sought refuge in their temple after a battle and then burned down the sacred grove without any regard for its sanctity. 
76. When Cleomenes sought guidance at Delphi, the oracle told him that he would conquer Argos. He then went to the river Erasinus with his Spartan soldiers. This river is believed to flow from the Stymphalian lake, which disappears into a hidden crevice and reemerges at Argos, where the Argives call it Erasinus. Upon reaching the river, Cleomenes offered sacrifices, but the omens did not favor his crossing. Acknowledging the river's loyalty to its people, Cleomenes warned that the Argives would still face consequences. He then withdrew his army and led them towards the coast at Thyrea. There, he sacrificed a bull to the sea and transported his soldiers by ship to the areas of Tiryns and Nauplia. 
77. The Argives learned about Cleomenes' actions and went to the coast to fight him. As they approached Tiryns, they set up camp near the Lacedaemonians at a place called Hesipeia, leaving only a small gap between the two armies. The Argives were not afraid of a fair fight, but they were worried about being tricked. This concern was related to an oracle given by the Pythian priestess to both the Argives and Milesians, which said: "When the female defeats the male and drives him away, winning glory in Argos, she will make many Argive women tear their cheeks. As someday one of the men to come will say: The dread thrice-coiled serpent died tamed by the spear." Fearing the fulfillment of this prophecy, the Argives decided to use the enemy's herald to their advantage. They did this by mimicking the Lacedaemonians' actions whenever the Spartan herald signaled something to them. 
78. When Cleomenes noticed that the Argives were copying his herald's signals, he came up with a plan. He ordered that when the herald gave the signal for breakfast, his soldiers should instead put on their armor and attack the Argives. The Lacedaemonians followed this command, and as they attacked, they found the Argives having breakfast, following the herald's signal. Many Argives were killed, and even more fled to the sacred grove of Argus for safety. The Lacedaemonians surrounded the grove and kept watch over it. 
79. Cleomenes then came up with another plan. He had some deserters with him who knew the names of the Argives hiding in the sacred grove. He sent a herald to call out the Argives by name, one by one, promising that he had paid their ransom. In the Peloponnesian region, there was a standard ransom of two minae for each prisoner. Following Cleomenes' orders, the herald called out about fifty Argives, who came out one after another, only to be killed by Cleomenes' men. The rest of the Argives in the grove were unaware of what was happening, as the grove was dense and they couldn't see the fate of those who went outside. Eventually, one of them climbed a tree and saw the ongoing massacre. After that, the remaining Argives refused to come out when the herald called their names. 
80. Cleomenes then ordered all the helots to gather wood and set fire to the grove. As the fire burned, he asked one of the deserters to whom the grove was dedicated. The deserter replied that it belonged to the god Argos. Hearing this, Cleomenes let out a groan and said, "Apollo, god of oracles, you have misled me by saying that I would capture Argos. I suppose this is the fulfillment of that prophecy." 
81. Cleomenes then sent the majority of his army back to Sparta, while he chose a thousand of his best warriors and went to the temple of Hera to offer a sacrifice. When he tried to perform the sacrifice at the altar, the priest stopped him, saying that it was not allowed for a stranger to do so. Cleomenes instructed the helots to remove the priest from the altar and whip him. After that, he completed the sacrifice and returned to Sparta. 
82. After returning to Sparta, Cleomenes' enemies accused him of taking a bribe to not capture Argos when he had the chance. In his defense, Cleomenes claimed (though it's unclear if it's true or false) that he believed the oracle's prophecy was fulfilled when he took the temple of Argus. As a result, he didn't want to attack the city until he had consulted the sacrifices to see if the god would support or oppose him. While performing the sacrifices at Hera's temple, a flame appeared from the chest of the statue, which made him realize that he wouldn't be able to take Argos. If the flame had come from the statue's head, it would have meant that he could completely conquer the city. However, the flame from the chest indicated that he had accomplished what the god intended. The Spartans found Cleomenes' explanation believable and reasonable, allowing him to avoid any punishment from his accusers. 
83. The city of Argos lost so many men that their slaves took control of everything, ruling and governing until the sons of the fallen men grew up. Once they were old enough, these sons reclaimed Argos for themselves and expelled the slaves. The slaves then forcefully occupied the city of Tiryns. For a while, both sides lived in peace. However, a prophet named Cleander, who was originally from Phigalea in Arcadia, came to the slaves and convinced them to attack their former masters. This led to a long-lasting war between the two groups, until eventually, the Argives managed to gain the upper hand with great difficulty. 
84. The people of Argos believed that Cleomenes went mad and met a terrible fate because of his actions against them. However, the Spartans had a different explanation for his madness. They claimed that Cleomenes became a heavy drinker of strong wine due to his association with the Scythians, and this led to his insanity. The Scythians, who were nomads, sought revenge against Darius for invading their land. They formed an alliance with Sparta, planning to invade Media via the Phasis River, while the Spartans would march inland from Ephesus to meet them. During this time, Cleomenes spent a lot of time with the Scythians, and it was from them that he learned to drink strong wine. The Spartans believed that his madness was a result of this excessive drinking. They even had a term for a strong drink, calling it "a Scythian cup." In my opinion, Cleomenes' punishment was more likely due to his actions against Demaratus. 
85. When the people of Aegina heard about Cleomenes' death, they sent messengers to Sparta to complain about Leutychides and the hostages held in Athens. The Spartans held a trial and found Leutychides guilty of mistreating the Aeginetans. They sentenced him to be handed over to the Aeginetans as compensation for the hostages in Athens. However, as the Aeginetans were about to take Leutychides away, a respected Spartan named Theasides, son of Leoprepes, warned them. He asked if they really intended to take the Spartan king away after the citizens had handed him over. He cautioned that if the Spartans had made this decision in anger, they might later retaliate and bring destruction upon Aegina. The Aeginetans took Theasides' advice and decided not to take Leutychides away. Instead, they agreed that he would accompany them to Athens and help secure the release of the Aeginetan hostages. 
86. When Leutychides arrived in Athens and demanded the return of the hostages, the Athenians were reluctant to comply. They argued that since two kings had entrusted the hostages to them, it would be wrong to return them to just one king. Leutychides responded by saying that whether they chose to return the hostages or not, they should hear a story about trust from Sparta. He told them about a man named Glaucus, the son of Epicydes, who lived three generations ago and was known for his exceptional sense of justice. A man from Miletus, hearing of Glaucus' reputation, decided to entrust half of his wealth to him for safekeeping, as he believed that Ionia was unstable compared to the Peloponnese. Glaucus agreed to keep the money and accepted tokens as proof of the deposit. After a long time, the sons of the man from Miletus came to Sparta, presented the tokens to Glaucus, and asked for their father's money back. Glaucus, however, claimed not to remember the agreement and asked for four months to consider the matter. Meanwhile, he went to Delphi to consult the oracle about whether he should keep the money by swearing an oath. The oracle warned him that although he might benefit from lying, the consequences would be dire for his family and descendants. Upon hearing this, Glaucus begged for forgiveness and was told that tempting the god was just as bad as committing the deed. He then returned to the sons of the man from Miletus and gave them their money back. Leutychides concluded his story by revealing that Glaucus' family line had been wiped out, emphasizing the importance of honoring a trust and returning what was entrusted when asked. The Athenians, after hearing this story, still refused to return the hostages to Leutychides. 
87. Leutychides spoke these words, but the Athenians still refused to listen to him, and he left. Before facing the consequences for their actions against the Athenians, which they had done to please the Thebans, the Aeginetans decided to take revenge on the Athenians. They believed they had been wronged by the Athenians, who were now celebrating a festival at Sunium that took place every five years. The Aeginetans set up an ambush and captured a sacred ship carrying many important Athenians. They imprisoned the people they had captured. 
88. After experiencing this attack from the Aeginetans, the Athenians were determined to take revenge on Aegina. There was a prominent man in Aegina named Nicodromus, son of Cnoethus, who held a grudge against the Aeginetans because they had banished him from the island in the past. When Nicodromus found out that the Athenians were planning to harm the Aeginetans, he agreed to betray Aegina to the Athenians. He told them the specific day he would carry out his plan and when they should come to support him. 
89. Later, Nicodromus, following his agreement with the Athenians, took control of the area known as the Old City. However, the Athenians didn't arrive on time to support him, as they didn't have ships capable of fighting the Aeginetans. While they were asking the Corinthians for help with ships, their plan fell apart. At that time, the Corinthians were close friends with the Athenians, so they agreed to help by providing twenty ships at a cost of five drachmas each. According to their laws, they couldn't give the ships for free. The Athenians combined these ships with their own, creating a fleet of seventy ships in total, and set sail for Aegina. Unfortunately, they arrived a day later than the agreed-upon time. 
90. When the Athenians didn't arrive on time, Nicodromus managed to escape from Aegina by boat. Other Aeginetans followed him, and the Athenians provided them with a place to live in Sunium. From there, they continued to cause trouble for the Aeginetans who remained on the island. 
91. However, this happened later. The wealthy individuals in Aegina took control over the common people who had rebelled against them with Nicodromus. They captured these people and planned to execute them. As a result, a curse fell upon the rich men, and despite their attempts to make sacrifices, they couldn't get rid of it. They were eventually forced to leave the island before the goddess would show them mercy. They had captured seven hundred people, and as they were leading them to be killed, one of them managed to escape his bonds and ran to the temple gate of Demeter the Lawgiver. He grabbed onto the door handles and clung to them tightly. The captors couldn't pull him away by force, so they cut off his hands and took him away. His hands remained attached to the door handles. 
92. The Aeginetans had conflicts among themselves. When the Athenians arrived, they fought against them at sea with seventy ships. The Aeginetans were defeated in the naval battle and asked the Argives for help, as they had done before. However, this time the Argives refused to help them, holding a grudge because Aeginetan ships had been forcibly taken by Cleomenes and used to attack the Argolid coast, along with the Lacedaemonians and ships from Sicyon. The Argives demanded a fine of a thousand talents, five hundred each from the Aeginetans and Sicyonians. The Sicyonians admitted their wrongdoing and agreed to pay a hundred talents, but the Aeginetans refused to confess and remained defiant. Because of this, the Argive government didn't send any help when the Aeginetans requested it. However, around a thousand volunteers went to assist them, led by a captain named Eurybates, who was a pentathlon athlete. Most of these volunteers never returned, as they were killed by the Athenians in Aegina. Eurybates, their captain, fought in single combat and managed to kill three men but was killed by the fourth, Sophanes, the son of Deceles. 
93. The Aeginetan ships discovered the Athenians in a chaotic state and launched an attack, defeating them. They captured four Athenian ships along with their crews. 
94. Athens and Aegina were engaged in a fierce war. Meanwhile, the Persian king was focused on his own agenda. His servant constantly reminded him to remember the Athenians, and the Pisistratidae were also speaking ill of the Athenians. Furthermore, King Darius wanted to use this opportunity to conquer all the Greek men who had not submitted to him by offering earth and water. He removed Mardonius from command due to his poor performance in the previous expedition and appointed new generals to lead his armies against Athens and Eretria. These generals were Datis, who was of Median descent, and Artaphrenes, the son of Artaphrenes and the king's nephew. Darius instructed them to enslave the people of Athens and Eretria and bring the captives before him. 
95. When the appointed generals left the king and arrived at the Aleian plain in Cilicia with a large and well-equipped army, they set up camp. They were soon joined by the assigned fleet and horse transports, which King Darius had ordered his subjects to prepare the previous year. After loading the horses and the land army onto the ships, they sailed to Ionia with six hundred triremes. Instead of sailing directly towards the Hellespont and Thrace along the mainland, they chose a different route. Starting from Samos, they sailed through the Icarian Sea and hopped from island to island. This decision was likely due to their fear of sailing around Athos, as they had experienced a significant disaster on that route the previous year. Additionally, Naxos remained unconquered and posed a challenge for them. 
96. As the Persians approached Naxos from the Icarian Sea, they planned to attack it first. However, the Naxians, recalling their previous encounters with the Persians, fled to the mountains instead of facing them. The Persians captured and enslaved any Naxians they found, burned their temples and city, and then sailed on to the other islands. 
97. When the Persians continued their attacks, the people of Delos fled to the nearby island of Tenos. As Datis led the expedition, he instructed his fleet to anchor near Rhenaea, across the water from Delos. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Delians, he sent a messenger to them with a message: "Honorable people, why have you fled, misunderstanding my intentions? Both I and the king have no desire to harm the land where the two gods were born, nor its people. Please return to your homes and live on your island." After delivering this message to the Delians, Datis offered a generous gift to the gods by burning three hundred talents of frankincense on the altar. 
98. After completing the ritual, Datis set sail with his army towards Eretria, accompanied by Ionians and Aeolians. As they departed, Delos experienced an earthquake, which the Delians claimed was the first and only one to occur before my time. I believe this event was a sign from the heavens, foreshadowing the troubles that would soon befall the world. During the reigns of three generations - Darius, his son Xerxes, and his grandson Artaxerxes - more disasters struck Greece than in the twenty generations before Darius. These troubles came from both the Persians and the wars for dominance among the leading Greek nations. Therefore, it was not surprising that an earthquake occurred in Delos, a place previously unshaken. There was also an oracle about Delos that said, "I will shake Delos, though unshaken before." In the Greek language, the names of the Persian kings have specific meanings: Darius means "the Doer," Xerxes means "the Warrior," and Artaxerxes means "the Great Warrior." The Greeks would accurately refer to these kings using these meanings in their language. 
99. Leaving Delos, the invaders sailed to nearby islands, recruiting soldiers and taking the islanders' children as hostages. When they arrived at Carystos, the people there refused to provide hostages or join the Persians in their fight against Eretria and Athens. In response, the Persians besieged Carystos and destroyed their land until the Carystians finally agreed to join them. 
100. When the people of Eretria found out that the Persians were coming to attack them, they asked the Athenians for help. The Athenians agreed and sent four thousand tenant farmers, who were also skilled fighters, to defend Eretria. However, the Eretrians were divided in their plans. Some wanted to leave the city and seek refuge in the mountains of Euboea, while others planned to betray their city, hoping to gain favor with the Persians. Aeschines, the son of Nothon and a prominent Eretrian, discovered both plans. He informed the Athenian reinforcements about the situation and advised them to return to Athens to avoid being caught in the conflict. The Athenians took Aeschines' advice and went back to their homeland. 
101. The Athenians managed to escape by crossing over to Oropus, while the Persians continued their journey towards the Eretrian territories of Temenos, Choereae, and Aegilea. Upon arriving, they quickly unloaded their horses and prepared to attack. The Eretrians, however, decided not to face the Persians in battle and focused on defending their city walls, as they had agreed not to abandon the city. For six days, both sides suffered casualties as the Persians relentlessly attacked the walls. On the seventh day, two influential Eretrians, Euphorbus and Philagrus, betrayed their city and allowed the Persians to enter. The Persians then plundered the city, burned the temples in retaliation for the destruction of their temples in Sardis, and enslaved the people, following Darius' orders. 
102. After conquering Eretria, the Persians waited for a few days before setting sail towards Attica. They were determined to do the same to the Athenians as they had done to the Eretrians. They chose Marathon as their landing site because it was the most suitable place for horse riding in Attica and was also close to Eretria. Hippias, the son of Pisistratus, guided them to Marathon. 
103. When the Athenians found out about the Persians' plan, they marched to Marathon, led by ten generals, one of whom was Miltiades. Miltiades' father, Cimon, had been exiled from Athens by Pisistratus. During his exile, Cimon won the Olympic prize in the four-horse chariot race, just like his half-brother Miltiades had done. In the next Olympics, Cimon won again with the same horses but allowed Pisistratus to be declared the winner. By doing this, Cimon was able to return to Athens and regain his property. Cimon won another Olympic prize with the same horses, but was later murdered by Pisistratus' sons in an ambush at night. He was buried near the city, across a road called "Through the Hollow," and his prize-winning horses were buried opposite him. Cimon's elder son, Stesagoras, was raised by his uncle Miltiades in the Chersonese, while his younger son, also named Miltiades, stayed in Athens. The younger Miltiades was named after the founder of the Chersonese, Miltiades. 
104. Miltiades, who had come from the Chersonese and narrowly escaped death twice, was now an Athenian general. The Phoenicians had chased him as far as Imbros, as they believed capturing him and bringing him to the king was crucial. Miltiades managed to evade them, but upon returning to Athens, he faced opposition from his enemies. They took him to court, accusing him of tyranny in the Chersonese. However, Miltiades was found not guilty and was appointed as an Athenian general by the people. 
105. While still in Athens, the generals sent a messenger named Philippides to Sparta. He was an Athenian long-distance runner by profession. Upon his return, Philippides told the Athenians that he had met the god Pan on a mountain above Tegea. Pan had asked him why the Athenians ignored him, even though he had been helpful to them in the past and would continue to be in the future. The Athenians believed this story, and when they became successful, they dedicated a sacred area to Pan beneath the Acropolis. Since then, they have honored him with yearly sacrifices and a torch race. 
106. Philippides reached Sparta the day after leaving Athens, where he had been sent by the generals and claimed to have seen Pan. He spoke to the Spartan leaders, saying, "Lacedaemonians, the Athenians ask for your help to prevent the oldest Greek city from falling into slavery under foreign rule. Eretria has already been enslaved, and this has weakened Greece by the loss of an important city." He relayed his message, and the Spartans agreed to help the Athenians. However, they couldn't do so immediately, as they didn't want to break their law. It was the ninth day of the month, and they believed they couldn't go to war until the moon was full. 
107. The Spartans waited for the full moon, while Hippias, the son of Pisistratus, guided the foreigners to Marathon. The night before, Hippias had a dream in which he slept with his mother. He interpreted the dream to mean that he would return to Athens, regain power, and live out his life in his homeland. With this in mind, he moved the slaves from Eretria to an island called Aegilia and anchored the ships at Marathon. He then organized the foreign troops on land. While doing this, Hippias suddenly sneezed and coughed violently. Being an older man, his teeth were loose, and he lost one due to the force of his cough. The tooth fell into the sand, and despite searching for it, he couldn't find it. Hippias groaned and told those around him, "This land is not ours, and we won't be able to conquer it. My tooth represents the only part of it that was mine." 
108. Hippias believed that his dream had come true in this way. Meanwhile, the Athenians gathered in the area of Heracles, and the people of Plataea came to support them with their full strength. The Plataeans had sought protection from the Athenians, who had helped them many times before. When the Plataeans were threatened by the Thebans, they first tried to seek protection from Cleomenes, the son of Anaxandrides, and the Lacedaemonians. However, they were told that they lived too far away to provide effective help and were advised to seek protection from the Athenians instead. The Lacedaemonians gave this advice not out of goodwill, but to create problems for the Athenians with the Boeotians. Following this advice, the Plataeans sought protection from the Athenians during a sacrificial ceremony. When the Thebans heard about this, they marched against the Plataeans, but the Athenians came to their aid. The Corinthians, who happened to be present, stopped the fighting and helped to negotiate a settlement. They set the boundaries of the land, stating that the Thebans should not bother those Boeotians who did not want to be part of Boeotia. After the Corinthians left, the Boeotians attacked the Athenians, but they were defeated. The Athenians then set new boundaries for the Plataeans, establishing the Asopus river as the border between Plataea and Hysiae. So, the Plataeans had sought protection from the Athenians in this way and now came to help them at Marathon. 
109. The Athenian generals had differing opinions: some believed they shouldn't fight because their numbers were too small to face the Medes' army, while others, including Miltiades, argued in favor of fighting. As a result, they couldn't agree, and the less favorable plan seemed to be winning. There was an eleventh person, chosen by lot to be the polemarch of Athens, whose vote held equal weight with the generals. At that time, Callimachus of Aphidnae was the polemarch. Miltiades approached Callimachus and said, "Callimachus, the fate of Athens is in your hands. You can either enslave our city or set it free, creating a legacy greater than that of Harmodius and Aristogeiton. Athens faces its greatest danger ever, and if we surrender, we know the suffering we'll face under Hippias. But if we win, our city will become the most important among the Greek cities. I'll explain how this can happen and how the deciding vote lies with you. The ten generals are divided, some wanting to attack and others not. If we don't attack now, I fear that internal conflicts will weaken the Athenians and lead them to side with the Medes. However, if we attack before any corruption takes hold, we can win the battle, provided the gods are just. All of this depends on your decision: if you vote with me, our country will be free and our city the greatest in Greece. But if you side with those who want to avoid battle, you'll lose all the good things I've mentioned." 
110. With these words, Miltiades convinced Callimachus. The polemarch's vote was added, and the decision to attack was made. After that, the generals who had voted to fight gave their leadership to Miltiades, one by one, as their days came. Miltiades took charge but didn't launch the attack until it was his turn to lead. 
111. When it was Miltiades' turn to lead, he arranged the Athenians for battle. Callimachus, the polemarch, commanded the right wing, as was the custom in Athens. The other tribes were placed in order next to each other, with the Plataeans positioned last, holding the left wing. Since that battle, during the Athenian festivals held every four years, the Athenian herald prays for blessings for both the Athenians and Plataeans. As the Athenians lined up at Marathon, their formation was as long as the Medes' line. The center of their line was weaker, with only a few ranks deep, but both wings had a larger number of soldiers. 
112. Once the Athenians were in position and the sacrifices showed positive signs, they charged towards the foreign army at a running pace. The distance between the two armies was about eight stadia. The Persians saw the Athenians running towards them and prepared for battle, thinking the Athenians were insane due to their small numbers and the fact that they were charging so quickly without any cavalry or archers. Despite the Persians' thoughts, when the Athenians attacked as a united force, they fought in a remarkable way. They were the first Greeks known to charge the enemy by running and the first to face the sight of Median clothing and the men wearing it without fear. Until that time, just hearing the name of the Medes would cause panic among the Greeks. 
113. The battle at Marathon lasted for a long time. In the center of the line, the foreign forces, consisting of Persians and Sacae, gained the upper hand. They broke through and pursued further inland. However, on both wings, the Athenians and Plataeans were victorious. Instead of chasing the fleeing foreigners, they joined forces to fight those who had broken through the center.  The Athenians emerged victorious and then pursued the fleeing Persians, striking them down. When they reached the sea, they called for fire and seized the Persian ships. 
114. During this battle, Callimachus, the brave polemarch, was killed, along with Stesilaus, the son of Thrasylaus, who was one of the generals. Cynegirus, the son of Euphorion, also died in the fight, losing his hand to an axe when he tried to grab a ship's figurehead. Many other well-known Athenians lost their lives in this battle as well. 
115. The Athenians managed to seize seven ships in the battle. The foreign forces retreated with the remaining ships, collected the Eretrian slaves from the island where they had been left, and sailed around Sunium, hoping to reach the city before the Athenians. There was a rumor in Athens that this plan was devised by the Alcmaeonidae family, who were accused of signaling the Persians with a raised shield once they were on their ships. 
116. The foreign forces sailed around Sunium, but the Athenians hurried back to defend their city, arriving before the foreigners. They moved from the sacred area of Heracles in Marathon to the sacred area of Heracles in Cynosarges and set up camp. Meanwhile, the foreign ships anchored off Phalerum, which was the Athenian naval port at that time. After staying there for a while, they eventually sailed back to Asia. 
117. During the battle at Marathon, around 6,400 foreign soldiers and 192 Athenians were killed. A strange event occurred during the battle: an Athenian named Epizelus, son of Couphagoras, fought bravely but suddenly lost his sight without being injured. He remained blind for the rest of his life. It is said that he told this story about his misfortune: he saw a tall, armed man with a beard covering his shield, but the figure passed by him and killed the man next to him. This is the story that Epizelus reportedly shared, according to my research. 
118. Datis traveled with his army to Asia, and while at Myconos, he had a dream. The details of the dream are unknown, but when he woke up, Datis searched his ships. He discovered a golden statue of Apollo in a Phoenician ship and asked where it had been taken from. After finding out its origin, he sailed to Delos, where the Delians had returned to their island. Datis placed the statue in the temple and told the Delians to move it to Theban Delium, located across from Chalcis. Datis then left, but the Delians never moved the statue. Twenty years later, the Thebans finally brought it to Delium, following the instructions of an oracle. 
119. When Datis and Artaphrenes arrived in Asia, they brought the enslaved Eretrians to Susa. King Darius had been very angry with the Eretrians for wronging him without reason, but when they were captured and brought before him, he didn't harm them. Instead, he settled them in a region called Ardericca in the Cissian land, which was part of his own territory. This place was 210 stadia away from Susa and 40 stadia from a unique well that produced asphalt, salt, and oil. To extract these resources, a windlass with a half-skin bucket was used to draw the materials from the well and pour them into a tank. The materials were then separated into different tanks, with the asphalt and salt solidifying immediately, while the oil, called "rhadinace" by the Persians, was dark and had a bad smell. King Darius settled the Eretrians in this area, and they lived there until my time, preserving their ancient language. That was the fate of the Eretrians. 
120. After the full moon, 2,000 Lacedaemonians quickly traveled to Athens, arriving in Attica just three days after leaving Sparta. Even though they missed the battle, they wanted to see the Medes, so they went to Marathon and saw them. Afterward, they left, praising the Athenians and their accomplishments. 
121. I find it hard to believe and doubt the story that the Alcmeonidae would have shown a shield as a signal to the Persians, wanting to make Athens subject to foreigners and Hippias. It's clear that they hated tyrants as much as Callias (son of Phaenippus and father of Hipponicus), or even more. Callias was the only Athenian brave enough to buy Pisistratus' properties when they were sold by the state after Pisistratus was expelled from Athens. He also carried out other acts of strong hatred against him. 
122. Thirdly, his actions towards his three daughters were remarkable. When they reached the age to get married, he gave them a wonderful and delightful gift. He promised that each daughter could choose her own husband from all the Athenians. 
123. The Alcmeonidae hated tyrants as much as Callias, if not more. So, I find it strange and hard to believe that they would have held up a shield. They always avoided tyrants, and it was their plan that led to the removal of Pisistratus' sons from power. In my opinion, they played a bigger role in freeing Athens than Harmodius and Aristogeiton. By killing Hipparchus, these two only angered the remaining sons of Pisistratus and didn't end their tyranny. However, the Alcmeonidae clearly liberated their country, especially if they were the ones who convinced the Pythian priestess to tell the Lacedaemonians to free Athens, as I mentioned earlier. 
124. Maybe they betrayed their country because they had a grudge against the people of Athens. However, they were highly respected and honored in Athens, so it doesn't make sense to think that they would have shown the shield for such a reason. It's true that a shield was shown, as it did happen, but I don't know who did it and can't say anything more about it. 
125. The Alcmeonidae family had always been well-known and respected in Athens, and their fame grew even more with Alcmeon and Megacles. When the Lydians from Sardis visited the Delphic oracle on behalf of King Croesus, Alcmeon, son of Megacles, helped them eagerly. Hearing about Alcmeon's assistance, Croesus invited him to Sardis and offered him a gift of as much gold as he could carry in one go. To make the most of this opportunity, Alcmeon wore a wide tunic with a deep fold and large boots. He was then taken to the treasury, where he found a pile of gold dust. He filled his boots and the fold of his tunic with gold, sprinkled some in his hair, and stuffed his mouth with it. When he left the treasury, barely able to walk due to the weight, he looked nothing like a human being. Croesus laughed at the sight and gave Alcmeon not only the gold he had taken but also an equal amount in addition. This made the family very wealthy, and Alcmeon became an owner of four-horse chariots, even winning a race at Olympia. 
126. In the next generation, Cleisthenes, the ruler of Sicyon, made the family even more prominent, making it very famous throughout Greece. Cleisthenes, the son of Aristonymus, grandson of Myron, and great-grandson of Andreas, had a daughter named Agariste. He wanted to marry her to the best man he could find in Greece. During the Olympic Games, after winning a four-horse chariot race, Cleisthenes announced that any Greek who believed himself worthy of being his son-in-law should come to Sicyon within sixty days or earlier. He promised to arrange the marriage within a year from that sixtieth day. Many Greeks who were proud of themselves and their country came as suitors. To determine the best among them, Cleisthenes organized running and wrestling competitions. 
127. From Italy, Smindyrides of Sybaris, son of Hippocrates, known for his luxurious lifestyle, and Damasus of Siris, son of Amyris the Wise, arrived. From the Ionian Gulf, Amphimnestus, son of Epistrophus, an Epidamnian, came. Males from Aetolia, brother of the strong Titormus, also joined. From the Peloponnese, Leocedes, son of Phidon the ruler of Argos, Amiantus, an Arcadian from Trapezus, Laphanes, an Azenian from Paeus, and Onomastus from Elis, attended. From Athens, Megacles, son of Alcmeon who visited Croesus, and Hippocleides, son of Tisandrus, known for his wealth and good looks, arrived. Lysanias from the prosperous Eretria in Euboea also joined. From Thessaly, Diactorides of Crannon, a Scopad, and Alcon from the Molossians, participated. 
128. The suitors arrived on the scheduled day, and Cleisthenes first asked about their background and lineage. He then spent a year with them, evaluating their character, temperament, upbringing, and lifestyle. He did this by spending time with them individually and in groups, organizing physical contests for the younger ones, and observing their behavior during shared meals. Throughout this time, he treated them with great hospitality and generosity. Cleisthenes was most impressed by the suitors from Athens, particularly Hippocleides, son of Tisandrus, who stood out for his manliness and connection to the Cypselids of Corinth through his ancestry. 
129. On the day of the marriage feast, Cleisthenes prepared a grand celebration, sacrificing a hundred oxen and inviting all the suitors and the people of Sicyon. After dinner, the suitors entertained each other with music and stories. As the night went on, Hippocleides, wanting to outshine the others, asked the flute-player to play a dance tune and began to dance. While he seemed to enjoy his performance, Cleisthenes disapproved of his actions. Hippocleides then took a break, brought in a table, and danced on it, performing various dance styles. Finally, he laid his head on the table and waved his legs in the air. Cleisthenes, unable to tolerate Hippocleides' behavior any longer, spoke up, "Son of Tisandrus, you have danced away your marriage." To which Hippocleides replied, "It does not matter to Hippocleides!" This phrase has since become a proverb. 
130. Cleisthenes asked everyone to be quiet and addressed the gathered suitors: "I am grateful to all of you for seeking my daughter's hand in marriage. If I could, I would grant each of your wishes, without favoring one over another or disappointing anyone. However, since I have only one daughter, I cannot please everyone. To those whose proposal is not accepted, I offer a talent of silver as a gift, in appreciation of your desire to marry into my family and for the time spent away from your homes. I now choose to betroth my daughter Agariste to Megacles, son of Alcmeon, according to the laws of the Athenians." Megacles accepted the betrothal, and Cleisthenes arranged the marriage. 
131. The story of the suitors' competition spread far and wide, making the Alcmeonidae family famous throughout Greece. From the marriage of Agariste and Megacles, a son named Cleisthenes was born, named after his maternal grandfather from Sicyon. This Cleisthenes introduced democracy and tribes to the Athenians. Megacles and Agariste also had another son, Hippocrates, who became the father of another Megacles and a daughter named Agariste, after her grandmother. This Agariste married Xanthippus, son of Ariphron. While pregnant, she had a dream in which she gave birth to a lion. Soon after, she gave birth to a son named Pericles, who would become a prominent figure in Athenian history. 
132. Following the Persian defeat at Marathon, Miltiades' fame in Athens grew even more. He requested the Athenians to provide him with seventy ships, an army, and money, without specifying which country he planned to attack. He promised to make them wealthy by taking them to a land filled with abundant gold. The Athenians, enticed by his promises, agreed to his request and provided him with the resources he asked for. 
133. Miltiades gathered his army and set sail for Paros, claiming that the Parians were responsible for sending ships to support the Persian fleet at Marathon. However, his true motive was a grudge against the Parians because Lysagoras, a man of Parian origin, had spoken ill of him to the Persian Hydarnes. Upon arriving at Paros, Miltiades and his army forced the Parians behind their city walls and laid siege to the city. He sent a messenger demanding a hundred talents, warning that if they didn't pay, his army would not leave until they had captured the city. The Parians had no intention of giving Miltiades any money and focused on defending their city. They secretly doubled the height of their most vulnerable walls at night and devised other strategies to protect themselves. 
134. The Greeks agree on the story up to this point, but the Parians have their own version of what happened next. They say that Miltiades found himself in a difficult situation when a captive woman named Timo, a Parian native and a junior priestess of the goddesses of the dead, came to speak with him. She advised Miltiades that if capturing Paros was crucial to him, he should follow her suggestion. Acting on her advice, Miltiades went to a hill near the city and jumped over the fence surrounding the sacred area of Demeter the Lawgiver, as he couldn't open the gate. Once inside, he approached the shrine, either to move something that shouldn't be moved or for some other purpose. However, as he reached the doors, he suddenly felt a wave of fear and rushed back the way he came. While jumping down from the wall, he injured his thigh, although some say it was his knee. 
135. Miltiades returned home in a poor state, having failed to bring money to the Athenians or conquer Paros. He had besieged the town for twenty-six days and caused destruction across the island. The Parians discovered that Timo, the junior priestess of the goddesses, had guided Miltiades and wanted to punish her for betraying her homeland and revealing sacred rituals to him. With the siege over, they sent messengers to Delphi to ask if they should execute the junior priestess for her actions. However, the Pythian priestess told them not to, explaining that Timo wasn't to blame. Miltiades was destined for a tragic end, and a supernatural force had led him to commit these wrongdoings. 
136. The priestess responded to the Parians in this way. Upon Miltiades' return to Athens, many people, especially Xanthippus, the son of Ariphron, criticized him. Xanthippus accused Miltiades of deceiving the Athenians and demanded the death penalty. Miltiades, unable to speak in his defense due to his festering thigh wound, was brought to court on a stretcher. His friends spoke on his behalf, highlighting his achievements at the Battle of Marathon and the capture of Lemnos. The people of Athens decided not to sentence Miltiades to death, but instead fined him fifty talents for his misconduct. Miltiades eventually died from an infection in his thigh, and his son Cimon paid the fifty talents. 
137. Miltiades, the son of Cimon, took control of Lemnos in the following manner: The Athenians had expelled the Pelasgians from Attica, but whether this was fair or not, I cannot say for certain. Hecataeus, the son of Hegesandrus, wrote in his history that the act was unjust. He claimed that the Athenians became envious when they saw the land they had given to the Pelasgians, in exchange for building a wall around the acropolis, being well-cultivated. Previously, the land had been poor and worthless, so the Athenians drove the Pelasgians out due to their envy and desire for the land. However, the Athenians themselves argue that their reasons for expelling the Pelasgians were justified. They claim that the Pelasgians, who lived at the base of Mount Hymettus, mistreated the Athenians' children when they went to fetch water from the Nine Wells. This was done out of arrogance and pride. The Pelasgians were also caught planning an attack on Athens. The Athenians, being more honorable, chose not to kill the Pelasgians but instead ordered them to leave the country. The Pelasgians then settled in Lemnos and other places. This is the Athenian version of the story, while the other account is provided by Hecataeus. 
138. At that time, the Pelasgians lived in Lemnos and wanted revenge on the Athenians. Knowing when the Athenian festivals took place, they used fifty-oared ships to ambush the Athenian women celebrating the festival of Artemis at Brauron. They kidnapped many women, took them to Lemnos, and made them their concubines. These women had children and taught them the language and customs of Athens. The boys didn't mix with the children of the Pelasgian women. If one of them was attacked, they would all help each other. They even claimed to rule over the others and were much stronger. The Pelasgians noticed this and worried about what the boys would do when they grew up, as they already tried to rule over the others and helped each other against the sons of the lawful wives. So, the Pelasgians decided to kill the sons of the Athenian women and their mothers. This act, along with an earlier one where the women killed their husbands who were companions of Thoas, led to the phrase "Lemnian crime" being used in Greece to describe any cruel deed. 
139. After the Pelasgians killed their own sons and women, their land stopped producing crops, and their wives, flocks, and herds no longer bore offspring as before. Struggling with hunger and childlessness, they sought help from the oracle at Delphi. The Pythian priestess instructed them to pay the Athenians whatever penalty the Athenians deemed appropriate. The Pelasgians went to Athens and offered to pay for their misdeeds. The Athenians set up a beautifully adorned couch in their town hall and placed a table filled with various delicacies beside it. They then told the Pelasgians to hand over their land in the same condition. The Pelasgians replied, "We will do so when a ship with a north wind can travel from your country to ours in one day." They believed this to be impossible since Attica is far south of Lemnos. 
140. At that time, nothing more happened. However, many years later, when the Chersonese region near the Hellespont came under Athenian control, Miltiades, the son of Cimon, managed to sail from Elaeus in the Chersonese to Lemnos, taking advantage of the constant Etesian winds. He announced that the Pelasgians must leave the island, reminding them of the oracle they believed would never come true. The people of Hephaestia complied, but those from Myrina refused to accept that the Chersonese was part of Attica. They were besieged until they too surrendered. In this way, Miltiades and the Athenians took control of Lemnos.
