0. This is a presentation of the research done by Herodotus from Halicarnassus. Its purpose is to ensure that the actions of people are not forgotten over time, and to preserve the amazing achievements of both the Greeks and non-Greeks. This includes understanding the reasons behind their conflicts with each other. 
1. The Persian scholars believe that the Phoenicians started the conflict. They say that the Phoenicians came from the Red Sea and settled in the area they still live in today. They began making long trips, trading Egyptian and Assyrian goods in various places, including Argos, which was the most important city in what is now called Greece. The Phoenicians arrived in Argos and started selling their goods. About five or six days later, when most of their items were sold, many women, including the king's daughter Io, came to the shore to shop. Both Persians and Greeks agree that Io was the daughter of Inachus. While the women were looking at the goods and negotiating prices, the Phoenicians decided to attack them. Most of the women managed to escape, but Io and some others were captured and taken aboard the ship, which then sailed to Egypt. 
2. The Persians say that Io's arrival in Egypt happened differently than the Greeks' version, and according to them, this was the first wrongdoing. They continue by saying that some Greeks, whose identity they don't know but were likely Cretans, went to Tyre in Phoenicia and kidnapped the king's daughter, Europa. At this point, both sides had committed one wrong each. However, the Persians claim that the Greeks were responsible for the next offense. They say that the Greeks traveled by ship to Aea, a city in Colchis, and to the Phasis River. After completing their mission there, they kidnapped the king's daughter, Medea. When the Colchian king sent a messenger to demand compensation for the kidnapping and the return of his daughter, the Greeks refused, saying that since they hadn't received any compensation for the abduction of Io from Argos, they wouldn't give any to the Colchians. 
3. The Persians continue their story by saying that a couple of generations later, Alexandrus, also known as Paris, who was the son of King Priam, heard about these events and decided to kidnap a wife from Greece, believing he wouldn't be punished for it. So, he took Helen. The Greeks initially planned to send messengers to demand Helen's return and compensation for her abduction. However, when they proposed this, the Trojans brought up the kidnapping of Medea and reminded the Greeks that they were demanding compensation from others while not offering any themselves, nor returning what they had taken. 
4. The Persians believe that up to this point, both sides were only guilty of kidnapping. However, they argue that the Greeks were more at fault because they invaded Asia before the Persians attacked Europe. The Persians think that kidnapping women is wrong, but trying to take revenge for it is foolish, as wise people would ignore such matters. They believe that the women wouldn't have been taken if they didn't want to be. The Persians themselves didn't react to the kidnapping of their women, but the Greeks, in response to the abduction of a woman from Lacedaemon (Sparta), gathered a large fleet, invaded Asia, and destroyed King Priam's kingdom. Since then, the Persians have considered the Greeks as their enemies. They see Asia and its inhabitants as their own, while they view Europe and the Greeks as separate from them. 
5. The Persians believe that their hatred for the Greeks began with the fall of Troy. However, the Phoenicians have a different version of the story about Io. They claim that they didn't kidnap her by force. Instead, Io had a relationship with the ship's captain in Argos and became pregnant. Feeling ashamed and not wanting her parents to find out, she willingly left with the Phoenicians. These are the stories told by the Persians and the Phoenicians. As for me, I won't say which story is true or false. Instead, I'll focus on identifying who I believe caused harm to the Greeks and continue with my historical account, discussing both small and large cities. Many once-great cities have now become small, and some that are great in my time were small in the past. Knowing that human prosperity is always changing, I'll mention both small and large cities in my account. 
6. Croesus was a Lydian, the son of Alyattes, and ruled over all the nations west of the Halys River, which flows from the south between Syria and Paphlagonia and empties into the Euxine Sea. He was the first foreign ruler known to have conquered some Greeks, collecting tribute from them, and befriending others. The conquered Greeks included the Ionians, Aeolians, and Asian Dorians, while the Lacedaemonians were his friends. Before Croesus' reign, all Greeks were free. The Cimmerian invasion of Ionia that happened before his time didn't subjugate the cities but instead raided and robbed them. 
7. The ruling power that belonged to the descendants of Heracles was passed to the family of Croesus, known as the Mermnadae, in the following way. Candaules, also called Myrsilus by the Greeks, was the ruler of Sardis and a descendant of Alcaeus, the son of Heracles. Agron, the son of Ninus, who was the son of Belus and the son of Alcaeus, was the first Heraclid king of Sardis, while Candaules, the son of Myrsus, was the last. Before Agron, the kings of this region were descendants of Lydus, the son of Atys, and the entire Lydian region was named after him. Previously, it was called the land of the Meii. The Heraclidae, who were descendants of Heracles and a female slave of Iardanus, received the ruling power from the previous kings due to an oracle. They ruled for twenty-two generations, or five hundred and five years, with each son succeeding his father, down to Candaules, the son of Myrsus. 
8. Candaules was deeply in love with his wife and believed she was the most beautiful woman in the world. He often praised her beauty to Gyges, his trusted bodyguard and confidant. One day, Candaules, headed for trouble, said to Gyges, "I don't think you truly believe me when I talk about my wife's beauty. People trust their eyes more than their ears, so you must see her naked." Gyges strongly objected, saying, "Master, that's a terrible idea, for me to see my mistress naked! A woman's modesty disappears when her clothes come off. There are wise rules that we should follow, and one of them is to mind our own business. I already believe your queen is the most beautiful woman, so please don't ask me to do something that's against the rules." 
9. Gyges hesitated, fearing that something bad would happen to him. But Candaules reassured him, saying, "Don't worry, Gyges! I'm not testing you, and my wife won't cause you any harm. I'll make sure she never knows you've seen her. I'll bring you into our bedroom and hide you behind the open door. When I go in, my wife will come to bed too. There's a chair near the entrance where she'll place her clothes as she takes them off, and you can look at her as much as you want. When she moves from the chair to the bed and turns her back to you, be careful not to be seen as you leave through the doorway." 
10. Gyges, feeling trapped, agreed to the plan. When it was time for bed, Candaules brought Gyges into the bedroom. Soon after, his wife entered and began undressing. Gyges saw her, and when she turned her back to go to bed, he quietly left the room. However, the woman caught a glimpse of him leaving and realized what her husband had done. Even though she felt humiliated, she didn't cry out or show any sign that she knew what happened. She planned to punish Candaules later, as in the Lydian culture and many other societies, it was considered a great shame for even a man to be seen naked. 
11. For the moment, the queen didn't react and remained silent. But as soon as daylight came, she gathered her most loyal servants and summoned Gyges. He, unaware that she knew what had happened, responded to her call, as he was used to attending to her whenever she needed him. When Gyges arrived, the queen said, "Gyges, you have two choices; decide which path you'll take. You must either kill Candaules and take me as your wife along with the throne of Lydia, or be killed yourself right now. This will stop you from obeying Candaules' orders in the future and seeing things you shouldn't. One of you must die: either him, who planned this, or you, who broke the rules by seeing me naked."  Gyges was shocked and asked her not to force him to make such a decision. But when he realized he couldn't change her mind and that he had to choose between killing his master or being killed himself, he chose to save his own life. Then he asked, "Since you're making me kill my master against my will, I need to know how we can catch him." She replied, "You'll approach him from the same place where he made you see me naked: attack him while he's asleep." 
12. After planning their scheme and waiting for nightfall, Gyges followed the queen into the bedroom. He had no choice but to go through with the plan, as either he or Candaules had to die. The queen handed him a dagger and hid him behind the same door as before. Soon after, Gyges crept out and killed the sleeping Candaules. In doing so, he gained control of the queen and the kingdom. This story is also mentioned in the iambic verses of Archilochus of Paros, a poet who lived around the same time. 
13. Gyges took over the kingdom and received approval from the Delphic oracle. The Lydians were unhappy with what happened to Candaules and prepared for battle. However, Gyges' supporters made a deal with the people: if the oracle declared Gyges as the rightful king of Lydia, he would rule; if not, he would return the throne to the Heraclidae family. The oracle agreed, and Gyges became king. But the Pythian priestess warned that the Heraclidae would take revenge on Gyges' descendants in the fifth generation. The Lydians and their kings didn't pay attention to this prophecy until it eventually came true. 
14. The Mermnadae family, led by Gyges, took the throne from the Heraclidae family. Once in power, Gyges sent many gifts to Delphi. There were numerous silver offerings, and among the gold offerings, six golden bowls were particularly noteworthy. These bowls weighed thirty talents and were stored in the treasury of the Corinthians, which actually belonged to Cypselus, son of Eetion. Gyges was the first foreigner known to have sent offerings to Delphi after the Phrygian king, Midas, son of Gordias. Midas also made a significant offering: the royal seat he used for making judgments, which was an impressive piece. This seat was placed in the same location as Gyges' bowls. The gold and silver offerings from Gyges were named "Gygian" by the Delphians in honor of the person who dedicated them. 
15. When Gyges became king, he followed the example of others and led an army to conquer the cities of Miletus and Smyrna. He also captured the city of Colophon. However, during his 38-year reign, he didn't achieve any other significant accomplishments, so I won't discuss him further. Instead, I'll talk about Ardys, Gyges' son, who succeeded him as king. Ardys captured Priene and attacked Miletus. During his rule, the Cimmerians, forced from their homes by the nomadic Scythians, arrived in Asia and seized Sardis, except for the acropolis. 
16. Ardys ruled for forty-nine years before his son Sadyattes took over, reigning for twelve years. After Sadyattes, Alyattes became king. He fought against Cyaxares, a descendant of Deioces, and the Medes. Alyattes forced the Cimmerians out of Asia, captured Smyrna (a colony of Colophon), and attacked the lands of Clazomenae. However, his campaign didn't go as planned and resulted in significant losses. These were the most notable events during his reign: 
17. Alyattes continued the war against the Milesians that his father had started. Here's how he attacked and besieged Miletus: He sent his army, accompanied by the sounds of pipes, harps, and flutes, to invade when the crops were ready for harvest. When they reached the Milesian territory, they didn't destroy or burn the houses or remove their doors; instead, they left them untouched. However, they destroyed the trees and crops before returning to their own land. Since the Milesians controlled the sea, it was pointless for Alyattes' army to besiege their city. The reason he didn't destroy the houses was so the Milesians could continue to farm and cultivate their land, providing more crops for his invading army to destroy in the future. 
18. The war continued for eleven years, during which the Milesians faced two major defeats: one at the battle of Limeneion in their own territory, and the other in the valley of the Maeander. For the first six years, Sadyattes, son of Ardys, ruled Lydia and led the attacks on Miletus, as he had started the war. In the following five years, his son Alyattes took over and continued the war with great determination, as I mentioned earlier. Throughout the conflict, none of the Ionians came to the aid of the Milesians, except for the Chians. They helped the Milesians because they had received help from them in their own war against the Erythraeans. 
19. In the twelfth year of the war, the Lydian army set fire to the crops. A strong wind caused the fire to spread, and it accidentally burned down the temple of Athena, known as Athena of Assesos. At the time, no one paid much attention to this incident. However, after the army returned to Sardis, Alyattes fell ill. As his sickness persisted, he decided to send messengers to Delphi to consult the oracle, either on someone's advice or his own desire to ask the god about his illness. When the messengers arrived at Delphi, the Pythian priestess refused to answer their questions until they rebuilt the temple of Athena at Assesos in the Milesian territory, which they had accidentally burned down. 
20. I am certain of this information because the Delphians told me. The Milesians also mentioned that Periander, son of Cypselus and a close friend of Thrasybulus, who was the ruler of Miletus at the time, found out about the oracle's response to Alyattes. So, he sent a messenger to inform Thrasybulus, allowing his friend to be prepared and make plans accordingly. 
21. According to the Milesians, that's how it happened. When Alyattes received the oracle's response, he quickly sent a messenger to Miletus, offering to make peace with Thrasybulus and the Milesians while he rebuilt the temple. The messenger then went to Miletus. However, Thrasybulus, already aware of the situation and knowing Alyattes' intentions, came up with a plan. He gathered all the food in the city, from both private and his own supplies, and placed it in the marketplace. He then instructed the people of Miletus to drink and celebrate together when he gave the signal. 
22. Thrasybulus did this so that when the messenger from Sardis saw the large amount of food and the people celebrating, he would report it back to Alyattes. And that's exactly what happened. The messenger observed everything, delivered the message from the Lydian to Thrasybulus, and returned to Sardis. As I understand, this was the main reason for the reconciliation between the two sides. Alyattes had believed that Miletus was suffering from a severe shortage of food and that the people were in a desperate situation. However, when his messenger returned from the city, he heard a completely different story. As a result, the Lydians and Milesians ended the war, agreed to become friends and allies, and Alyattes built not just one, but two temples of Athena at Assesos. After that, he recovered from his illness. This is the story of Alyattes' war against Thrasybulus and the Milesians. 
23. Periander, the one who revealed the oracle's answer to Thrasybulus, was the son of Cypselus and the ruler of Corinth. Both the Corinthians and the Lesbians agree that the most amazing event in his life was when Arion of Methymna, a talented musician, was brought to Taenarus by a dolphin. Arion was an exceptional lyre-player during his time. He was the first person known to create and give a name to the dithyramb, a type of music that he later taught in Corinth. 
24. The story goes that Arion, who spent most of his time with Periander, wanted to travel to Italy and Sicily. After making a lot of money there, he decided to return to Corinth. Trusting the Corinthians more than anyone else, he hired a Corinthian ship to take him from Tarentum. However, while at sea, the crew planned to steal Arion's money and throw him overboard. When Arion found out, he begged for his life and offered them all his money. But the crew refused to listen and told him to either kill himself and be buried on land or jump into the sea immediately. Left with no choice, Arion asked if he could, at least, stand on the deck in his full attire and sing one last time before ending his life. The crew, excited to hear the world's best singer, agreed and moved away from the stern. Arion, dressed in his finest clothes and holding his lyre, sang the "Stirring Song." After finishing the song, he jumped into the sea with all his attire. The crew continued their journey to Corinth, but a dolphin (as the story goes) saved Arion by carrying him on its back to Taenarus. From there, Arion went to Corinth in his full attire and told Periander everything that had happened. Skeptical, Periander kept Arion under house arrest and waited for the sailors to arrive. When they did, he asked them about Arion's whereabouts. They claimed that Arion was safe in Italy and doing well in Tarentum. At that moment, Arion appeared before them, dressed exactly as he was when he jumped from the ship. The astonished sailors could no longer deny the truth. This is the story told by the Corinthians and Lesbians. There is even a small bronze statue at Taenarus, depicting a man riding a dolphin, in memory of Arion. 
25. Alyattes, the Lydian king, passed away after ruling for fifty-seven years and ending his war with the Milesians. He was the second person in his family to donate a large silver bowl on a welded iron stand to Delphi as a gift of gratitude for recovering from his illness. Among all the offerings at Delphi, this one is the most impressive and was created by Glaucus, a craftsman from Chios. Glaucus was the only person who had discovered the technique of welding iron. 
26. After Alyattes passed away, his 35-year-old son, Croesus, became the king. The first Greeks he attacked were the Ephesians. As they were besieged by Croesus, they dedicated their city to the goddess Artemis by connecting a rope from the city wall to her temple, which was seven stades away from the ancient city under siege. After that, Croesus waged war on the Ionian and Aeolian cities one by one, using various reasons for each attack. Sometimes he had serious accusations, but other times, he used minor offenses as grounds for war. 
27. After conquering all the mainland Greek cities in Asia and forcing them to pay tribute, Croesus decided to build ships and attack the island Greeks. However, while preparing for shipbuilding, either Bias of Priene or Pittacus of Mytilene (the story mentions both) visited Sardis. When Croesus asked for news about Greece, the visitor cleverly stopped the shipbuilding plans by saying, "O King, the islanders are buying ten thousand horses, planning to march against you in Sardis."  Believing the visitor, Croesus replied, "I wish the gods would make the islanders come on horseback against the Lydians!" The visitor then said, "O King, it's natural for you to want to catch the islanders fighting on land. But when they heard you were building ships to attack them, they must have wished to catch the Lydians at sea, to avenge the enslaved mainland Greeks."  Croesus was pleased with this reasoning, as it made sense to him. He took the advice, stopped building ships, and made peace with the Ionians living on the islands. 
28. Over time, Croesus conquered nearly all the nations west of the Halys River. Apart from the Cilicians and Lycians, he ruled over various other groups. These included the Lydians, Phrygians, Mysians, Mariandynians, Chalybes, Paphlagonians, Thracian Thynians, Bithynians, Carians, Ionians, Dorians, Aeolians, and Pamphylians. 
29. After Croesus conquered these nations and added them to his Lydian empire, many wise people from Greece visited Sardis, which was very prosperous at the time. One of these visitors was Solon, an Athenian who had created laws for his city. He decided to travel the world for ten years, claiming he wanted to see new places. This also allowed him to avoid being forced to change any of the laws he had made. The Athenians had sworn to follow Solon's laws for ten years, and they couldn't change them during that time. 
30. Solon traveled to visit Amasis in Egypt and then Croesus in Sardis for two reasons: to see the world and to satisfy his curiosity. When he arrived in Sardis, Croesus welcomed him into the palace. After a few days, Croesus asked his servants to show Solon his treasures. Once Solon had seen everything, Croesus asked him, "As a wise traveler, who is the most fortunate person you have ever met?" Croesus expected Solon to choose him, but Solon honestly replied, "O King, it is Tellus the Athenian." Surprised by the answer, Croesus asked, "Why do you think Tellus is the most fortunate?" Solon explained, "Tellus lived in a prosperous city and had good, noble children. He saw his children have their own kids, who all survived. He lived a comfortable life and died a glorious death. When the Athenians fought against their neighbors in Eleusis, Tellus joined the battle, helped defeat the enemy, and died heroically. The Athenians honored him by burying him at public expense where he fell and giving him great respect." 
31. When Solon mentioned Tellus as the most fortunate person, Croesus asked who he thought was next, hoping to be chosen. Solon replied, "Cleobis and Biton, two brothers from Argos. They had enough to live on and were very strong athletes. Once, during a festival for the goddess Hera, their mother needed to be taken to the temple by a team of oxen. However, the oxen didn't return from the fields in time, so the brothers carried the yoke on their shoulders and pulled the wagon with their mother on it for five miles to the temple.  When they arrived, everyone saw what they had done, and their lives ended in a perfect way. The god showed that it's better for humans to die than to live. The men of Argos praised the brothers for their strength, and the women praised their mother for having such children. Overwhelmed with happiness and pride, their mother prayed to the goddess to grant her children the best thing for them. After the prayer, they all celebrated with a feast. The brothers fell asleep in the temple and never woke up, as death took them. The people of Argos honored them by dedicating statues at Delphi, considering them the best of men." 
32. Solon ranked these men as second happiest, which annoyed Croesus. He asked, "Do you think so little of our happiness that you consider us less fortunate than ordinary people?" Solon replied, "Croesus, you're asking about human life, and I know that the divine can be very unpredictable and challenging for us. Over a long time, we may experience many unwanted things. I believe a person's life lasts about seventy years, which is around 25,200 days, not counting extra months. If we add those extra months, we get 26,250 days in total, and no two days are the same. So, life is full of uncertainties. You seem very wealthy and powerful, but I can't say you're fortunate until I know you've had a good life. A rich person isn't happier than someone with just enough to live on, unless their life ends well. Many rich people are unhappy, while many with less are fortunate. A rich person can satisfy their desires and handle disasters better, but a fortunate person may not face such problems. They are free from illness, have good-looking children, and don't experience hardships. If their life ends well, they can be called fortunate. But don't call someone fortunate until they die; call them lucky instead. No human can have everything at once, just like no land has all the resources it needs. Each person has something but lacks another. The one who lives with the most blessings and dies peacefully is the one who deserves to be called fortunate. We must see how each life ends, as the gods may promise fortune to many but ultimately ruin them." 
33. Solon's words didn't please Croesus at all. He dismissed Solon, thinking he was a fool for not appreciating the present happiness and instead focusing on how things would end. 
34. After Solon left, Croesus faced divine punishment, probably because he believed he was the most fortunate man. One night, he had a dream that revealed the terrible fate of his son. He had two sons; one was mute, and the other, named Atys, was the best among his peers. The dream showed Atys being killed by an iron spear.  When Croesus woke up, he was terrified by the dream. He quickly found a wife for Atys and stopped sending him on military missions, even though Atys used to lead the Lydian armies. Croesus also removed all the weapons, like javelins and spears, from the men's quarters and stored them away, fearing that one might fall and kill his son. 
35. While Croesus was busy with his son's wedding, a distressed man from the Phrygian royal family arrived in Sardis with unclean hands. He went to Croesus' house and asked to be purified according to local customs. Croesus performed the purification ritual, which was similar to the Greek one. After completing the ritual, he asked the man about his background and why he needed purification. The man replied, "My king, I am Adrastus, the son of Gordias and grandson of Midas. I accidentally killed my brother and was banished by my father, losing everything." Croesus responded, "Your family has always been my friends. You are welcome in my home, where you will have everything you need. As for your unfortunate situation, try to bear it as lightly as possible, and you will benefit the most." 
36. Adrastus lived in Croesus' house during this time. Meanwhile, a huge boar appeared on Mysian Olympus, causing destruction in the Mysian fields. The Mysians tried to fight the boar but failed and were injured instead. They sent messengers to Croesus, asking for help: "O King, a giant boar is destroying our land, and we can't kill it. Please send your son, some skilled young men, and dogs to help us drive it away." Croesus, remembering the prophecy from his dream, replied, "Don't mention my son again. I won't send him with you, as he is newly married and focused on that. However, I will send some chosen Lydians, hunters, and dogs. I'll instruct them to do their best to help you drive the beast away." 
37. Croesus responded this way, and the Mysians were content with his answer. However, Croesus' son, who had overheard their request, spoke up. He said, "Father, it used to be considered honorable for us to go to war and participate in hunts, earning respect and recognition. But now you've stopped me from doing both, even though I've never shown cowardice or lack of courage. How can I face others when I go to the marketplace? What will the people in the city think of me, and what about my new wife? What kind of man will she believe she married? Either let me join the hunt or explain to me why your decision is the best for me." 
38. Croesus replied, "My son, I'm not doing this because I think you're cowardly or unworthy. Instead, I had a dream that warned me you would have a short life, killed by an iron spear. That's why I arranged your marriage quickly and don't let you participate in any dangerous activities. I'm trying to protect you, so maybe I can prevent your death while I'm still alive. You're my only son, as your brother is no longer part of my life due to his misfortune." 
39. "Father," the young man replied, "I understand why you want to protect me after having such a dream. However, I need to point out something you might not have considered about its meaning. You said the dream warned you that I would be killed by an iron spear. But does a boar have hands? Does it have the iron spear you fear? If the dream had said I would be killed by a tusk or something else related to a boar, your actions would make sense. But it mentioned a spear. So, since we're not fighting against men, please let me go." 
40. Croesus replied, "My son, your interpretation of the dream has given me some comfort. Since you've reassured me, I've changed my mind and will allow you to join the hunt." 
41. Croesus said, "Adrastus, when you faced terrible misfortune, which I don't hold against you, I helped you, welcomed you into my home, and have been taking care of you ever since. Now, as a way to repay my kindness, I ask you to protect my son during the hunt. Make sure no dangerous criminals cross your path and cause harm. Also, it's important for you to participate in activities that bring honor to your family, as you are your father's son and have the strength to do so." 
42. "O King," Adrastus replied, "I wouldn't have chosen to join such an event on my own. As someone who has faced misfortune, I don't feel comfortable being around successful people, and I have many reasons to avoid it. But since you insist and I need to repay your kindness, I'm willing to participate. As for your son, I'll do my best to protect him and ensure he returns safely." 
43. After Adrastus responded to Croesus, they set out with a group of selected young men and hunting dogs. Upon reaching Mount Olympus, they found the beast, surrounded it, and threw their spears. Adrastus, the man who had been forgiven for his past crime, accidentally missed the boar and hit Croesus's son, Atys, with his spear. This fulfilled the prophecy of the dream. Someone rushed back to Sardis to inform Croesus about the tragic event and the fate of his son. 
44. Overwhelmed by his son's death, Croesus was even more upset because the killer was someone he had forgiven for a past crime. In his immense grief, he called upon Zeus using three names - Zeus the Purifier, Zeus of the Hearth, and Zeus of Comrades. He invoked Zeus the Purifier to show the god the terrible deed his guest had committed. He called upon Zeus of the Hearth because he had unknowingly welcomed his son's murderer into his home. Lastly, he invoked Zeus of Comrades because the person he had sent to protect his son turned out to be his worst enemy. 
45. Soon, the Lydians arrived, carrying the lifeless body, with the remorseful killer following behind. Adrastus stood before the body, offering himself to Croesus and asking to be killed over the corpse. He spoke of his past misfortune and how he had now killed the one who had forgiven him, believing he didn't deserve to live. Despite his immense grief, Croesus felt pity for Adrastus and said, "Friend, you've already paid the full price by sentencing yourself to death. I don't blame you for this tragedy, as you did it unwillingly. Instead, I blame one of the gods who foretold this long ago." Croesus then buried his son with proper rites. Adrastus, the son of Gordias and grandson of Midas, who had killed both his own brother and the man who had purified him, took his own life at the undisturbed tomb. He realized that he was the most tormented person he knew. 
46. After losing his son, Croesus grieved deeply for two years. Eventually, the growing power of the Persians under Cyrus, who had overthrown Astyages, distracted him from his sorrow. He decided to try and stop the Persians from becoming even more powerful. With this in mind, he sought guidance from various Greek and Libyan oracles. He sent messengers to Delphi, Abae in Phocia, Dodona, Amphiaraus, Trophonius, and Branchidae in the Milesian region. These were the Greek oracles he consulted, while others were sent to inquire at the oracle of Ammon in Libya. Croesus' intention was to test the oracles' accuracy. If they proved to be reliable, he would consult them again to ask whether he should launch an attack against the Persians. 
47. When Croesus sent messengers to test the oracles, he instructed the Lydians to carefully count the days from their departure from Sardis. On the hundredth day, they were to ask the oracles what Croesus, the king of Lydia and son of Alyattes, was doing at that moment. They were to record the oracles' responses and bring them back to him. There is no record of the answers given by the other oracles, but at Delphi, as soon as the Lydians entered the hall and asked their question, the Pythian priestess spoke these lines: "I know the number of grains of sand and the size of the sea, I understand the silent and hear the unspoken. The scent of a hard-shelled tortoise cooking with lamb's meat In a bronze pot has reached me, with bronze above and below." The Lydians wrote down the priestess's words and returned to Croesus with her response. 
48. After noting down the words of the Pythian priestess, the Lydians returned to Sardis. Meanwhile, the other messengers who had been sent to various oracles also came back with their responses. Croesus carefully read all the written answers, but most of them did not satisfy him. However, when he read the message from Delphi, he accepted it with reverence and approval, believing that Delphi was the only true oracle because it had accurately described what he had done. After sending his envoys to the oracles, Croesus had come up with a task that would be nearly impossible to guess. On the designated day, he had chopped up a tortoise and a lamb, and then boiled them together in a bronze cauldron with a bronze lid. The Delphian oracle's response had correctly identified this unusual act. 
49. The answer from Delphi was given to Croesus as described earlier. Regarding the response from the oracle of Amphiaraus, it is not known what it was, as there is no record of it. However, it is known that Croesus believed he had also received a truthful answer from this oracle, after the Lydians had followed the temple's proper customs. 
50. After that, Croesus tried to gain the Delphian god's favor by offering generous sacrifices. He sacrificed three thousand animals suitable for such offerings and burned a large pile of valuable items, including gold and silver-covered couches, golden cups, and purple cloaks and tunics. He hoped that these actions would help him gain the god's support. Croesus also instructed every Lydian to offer their own sacrifices. Once the sacrifices were completed, Croesus melted a huge amount of gold and created gold bars. The longer sides of these bars were six palms long, the shorter sides were three palms long, and the height was one palm. He made a total of 117 gold bars. Four of them were made of pure gold, each weighing two and a half talents, while the rest were made of gold mixed with silver, each weighing two talents. Croesus also had a lion statue made of pure gold, weighing ten talents. When the temple of Delphi was destroyed by fire, the gold lion fell from the gold bars that served as its base. The lion now resides in the treasury of the Corinthians, but it weighs only six and a half talents, as the fire melted away three and a half talents of its original weight. 
51. Croesus prepared his offerings and sent them to Delphi, along with other gifts. These included two large bowls, one made of gold and the other of silver. The gold bowl was placed to the right and the silver one to the left of the temple entrance. Both bowls were moved when the temple was burned down. The gold bowl, weighing eight and a half talents and twelve minae, is now in the treasury of the Clazomenians. The silver bowl is located at the corner of the temple's forecourt and can hold six hundred nine-gallon measures. The Delphians use it as a mixing bowl during the Feast of the Divine Appearance. They believe it was crafted by Theodorus of Samos, and its exceptional workmanship supports this claim. Croesus also sent four silver casks that are now in the treasury of the Corinthians, as well as two sprinkling vessels, one made of gold and the other of silver. The gold vessel has an inscription claiming it was a gift from the Lacedaemonians, but this is incorrect; it was actually another gift from Croesus. A Delphian, whose name is known but not mentioned, added the inscription to please the Lacedaemonians. The statue of a boy, which serves as a water conduit, is indeed a gift from the Lacedaemonians, but they did not give either of the sprinkling vessels. In addition to these gifts, Croesus sent several silver basins and a five-foot-tall female statue, which the Delphians claim represents Croesus' baker. He also dedicated his wife's necklaces and belts as offerings. 
52. Croesus sent these gifts to Delphi. He also sent offerings to Amphiaraus, having heard about his bravery and destiny. These offerings included a shield made entirely of gold and a solid gold spear, with both the point and shaft made of gold. Until my time, these items were located in Thebes, inside the temple of Ismenian Apollo. 
53. Croesus instructed the Lydians, who were responsible for delivering the gifts to the temples, to ask the oracles if he should send an army against the Persians and if he should gather allies for his cause. When the Lydians arrived at their destinations, they presented the offerings and asked the oracles the following question: "Croesus, king of Lydia and other nations, believes that these are the only true places of divination among men. He offers you gifts worthy of your wisdom. He now asks if he should send an army against the Persians and if he should gather an army of allies." Both oracles provided the same answer to Croesus: if he sent an army against the Persians, he would destroy a great empire. They also advised him to find the strongest Greeks and make them his friends. 
54. When Croesus received the responses from the oracles, he was very pleased. Believing that he would destroy Cyrus's kingdom, he sent gifts to the Delphians once again. He gave each Delphian two gold coins, having learned their number beforehand. In return, the Delphians granted Croesus and all Lydians special privileges, including priority in consulting the oracle, exemption from fees, the best seats at festivals, and the option of permanent Delphian citizenship for anyone who desired it. 
55. After giving gifts to the Delphians, Croesus asked the oracle a third question, as he wanted to make the most of its accurate answers. He inquired about the longevity of his reign. The Pythian priestess responded with the following message: "When the Medes have a mule as their king, it's time for you, gentle Lydian, to flee by the rocky banks of the Hermus River. Don't hesitate, and don't be ashamed to be a coward." 
56. When Croesus heard these lines, he was very pleased. He believed that a mule would never become the king of the Medes, and therefore, his empire and his descendants would remain safe. He then carefully investigated which Greeks were the most powerful, so he could befriend them. He discovered that the Lacedaemonians were the strongest among the Doric people, and the Athenians were the strongest among the Ionic people. These two groups, the Ionians and Dorians, were the most prominent in ancient times, with the Ionians being of Pelasgian origin and the Dorians of Hellenic origin. The Pelasgian race never left its homeland, while the Hellenic race moved around often. During the reign of King Deucalion, the Hellenic people lived in the land of Phthia. Later, they moved to the region called Histiaean, located under Mount Ossa and Mount Olympus, during the time of Dorus, the son of Hellen. Forced out of Histiaean by the Cadmeans, they settled near Mount Pindus in the area known as Macedonian. From there, they moved to Dryopia, and finally, they arrived in the Peloponnese, where they became known as the Dorians. 
57. It's difficult to say for certain what language the Pelasgians spoke. However, we can make some assumptions based on the remaining Pelasgians who live above the Tyrrheni in the city of Creston. These people were once neighbors of the Dorians and lived in the region now known as Thessalian. We can also consider the Pelasgians who lived in Placia and Scylace on the Hellespont, who later moved to Athens, as well as other towns that were once Pelasgian but later changed their names. Based on these examples, it seems that the Pelasgians spoke a language that was not Greek. If all Pelasgians spoke this non-Greek language, then the Attic people, who were of Pelasgian origin, must have changed their language when they became part of the Hellenes. The people of Creston and Placia have their own unique language, which is different from that of their neighbors. It's clear that they still maintain the language they brought with them when they migrated to their current locations. 
58. It appears to me that the Hellenic people have always spoken the same language since their origin. Although they started as a small group when they separated from the Pelasgians, they eventually grew into a large collection of nations. This growth was mainly due to the Pelasgians and other foreign groups joining them. Before this, when the Pelasgians spoke a different language, their population did not increase significantly. 
59. Croesus learned that the Attic people were under the control of Pisistratus, the son of Hippocrates, who ruled over the Athenians. A strange event had once happened to Hippocrates when he was at Olympia for the games. The pots filled with meat and water began to boil without fire until they overflowed. Chilon, a Lacedaemonian who witnessed this, advised Hippocrates not to have children with his wife or to disown his son if he already had one. However, Hippocrates ignored this advice, and later, Pisistratus was born. Pisistratus wanted power, so he created a third faction among the Athenians, who were already divided between the coastal and plain regions. He gathered supporters and pretended to be on the side of the uplanders. To gain sympathy, he wounded himself and his mules, claiming that he had escaped an assassination attempt. The Athenian people, impressed by his military achievements against the Megarians, granted him a group of guards armed with wooden clubs. With their help, Pisistratus took control of the Acropolis and became the ruler of the Athenians. He did not disrupt the existing government or change the laws but governed the city fairly and well, according to its established constitution. 
60. Not long after, the supporters of Megacles and Lycurgus joined forces and drove Pisistratus out of power. However, as their rivalry resumed, Megacles, struggling with the ongoing conflict, offered Pisistratus his daughter's hand in marriage and the chance to regain power. Pisistratus accepted the offer, and they came up with a plan to bring him back to power, which was quite foolish. They found a woman named Phya, who was almost six feet, four inches tall, and dressed her in full armor, placing her in a chariot to create an impressive scene. As they entered the city, heralds ran ahead, announcing that Athena herself was bringing Pisistratus back to the city. The news spread quickly, and the people of Athens, believing the woman to be the goddess, worshipped her and welcomed Pisistratus back into power. 
61. Pisistratus regained power as described earlier and married Megacles' daughter as per their agreement. Since he already had sons and the Alcmeonid family was believed to be cursed, he didn't want his new wife to have children, so he had an unconventional relationship with her. Eventually, the wife confided in her mother, who then told Megacles. Angered by Pisistratus' actions, Megacles reconciled with the rival faction. Upon learning about these events, Pisistratus left the country and went to Eretria to discuss the situation with his sons. They decided to regain power, so they began collecting funds from cities that owed them favors. Many cities contributed generously, with Thebans giving the most. Over time, they gathered enough resources for their return, including hiring Argive mercenaries from the Peloponnese. A man from Naxos named Lygdamis also joined their cause, providing them with additional money and men. 
62. After ten years, Pisistratus and his supporters left Eretria and returned to Attica, where they first captured Marathon. While there, more supporters from the city and countryside joined them, preferring a single ruler over freedom. The Athenians in the city, who had ignored Pisistratus' earlier efforts, now took notice and prepared to attack him as he marched from Marathon towards Athens. The two forces met near the temple of Pallenian Athena, where they set up camps facing each other. At this point, a diviner named Amphilytus from Acarnania approached Pisistratus and shared a prophecy in the form of a poem: "The cast is made, the net spread, the tunny-fish shall flash in the moonlit night." 
63. Amphilytus shared his prophecy, and Pisistratus, understanding its meaning, led his army against the enemy. By that time, the city's Athenians had finished breakfast, and some were playing games while others were sleeping. Pisistratus' men attacked them, causing them to flee. To keep the fleeing Athenians scattered and prevent them from regrouping, Pisistratus came up with a clever plan. He sent his sons on horseback to catch up with the fugitives and deliver a message: they should not be afraid and should return to their homes. This message was given as instructed by Pisistratus. 
64. The Athenians followed the instructions, and as a result, Pisistratus took control of Athens for the third time. He secured his rule with a strong guard and revenue collected from both Athens and the Strymon River region. He also took the sons of the remaining Athenians as hostages and placed them in Naxos, which he had conquered and put under Lygdamis' control. Additionally, Pisistratus purified the island of Delos in response to oracles. He did this by removing all the dead buried within sight of the temple and relocating them to another part of Delos. Thus, Pisistratus ruled over Athens, while some Athenians had died in battle and others, including the Alcmeonids, were exiled from their homeland. 
65. Croesus learned that the Athenians were facing problems at that time, while the Lacedaemonians had overcome great challenges and defeated the Tegeans in war. During the reign of Leon and Hegesicles in Sparta, the Lacedaemonians were successful in all their wars except against the Tegeans. Before this, they had been poorly governed and isolated from other people. However, their government improved when Lycurgus, a respected Spartan, visited the oracle at Delphi. Upon entering, the priestess spoke in verse, expressing her uncertainty about whether Lycurgus was a man or a god, but leaning towards him being a god. Some say that the priestess revealed the current Spartan constitution to Lycurgus, but the Lacedaemonians believe he brought it from Crete when he became the guardian of his nephew, King Leobetes of Sparta. As guardian, Lycurgus changed all the laws and ensured no one broke the new ones. He later established their military system, including sworn divisions, bands of thirty, common meals, ephors, and the council of elders. 
66. The Lacedaemonians changed their bad laws to good ones, and after Lycurgus' death, they built a temple in his honor and worshipped him greatly. With fertile land and a large population, they flourished and prospered. However, they were not satisfied with living in peace and, believing they were stronger than the Arcadians, asked the oracle at Delphi about conquering all of Arcadia. The oracle replied in verse, denying their request for Arcadia but offering them Tegea to dance upon and measure its beautiful plain with a rope. Upon hearing the oracle's response, the Lacedaemonians left the other Arcadians alone and marched towards Tegea, carrying chains, misled by the oracle's words. They were confident they would enslave the Tegeans, but instead, they were defeated in battle. The captured Lacedaemonians were bound with the very chains they had brought and forced to work in the fields, measuring the Tegean plain with a rope. In my time, those chains were still displayed, hanging in the temple of Athena Alea. 
67. In an earlier war, the Lacedaemonians had repeatedly fought unsuccessfully against the Tegeans. However, during the time of Croesus and the reign of Anaxandrides and Ariston in Lacedaemon, the Spartans gained the upper hand. Here's how it happened: after suffering defeats against the Tegeans, they sent ambassadors to Delphi to ask which god they should appease to win the war. The Pythia replied that they should bring back the bones of Orestes, son of Agamemnon. Unable to find Orestes' tomb, they once again asked the oracle for its location. The Pythia answered in verse, describing a place in Tegea, Arcadia, where two winds blow forcefully, and where Orestes was buried. She said that if they brought him back, they would become the rulers of Tegea. Despite the oracle's response, the Lacedaemonians still struggled to find the tomb, searching everywhere. Eventually, Lichas, one of the Spartans known as "doers of good deeds," discovered it. These men were citizens who retired from the knights, with the five oldest retiring each year. During their retirement year, they were sent on various missions by the Spartan state, never resting in their efforts. 
68. Lichas, one of the "doers of good deeds," found the tomb in Tegea through a mix of luck and skill. At that time, Tegea was freely accessible, so he visited a blacksmith's shop and watched iron being forged, amazed by the process. The blacksmith noticed Lichas' amazement and stopped working to tell him about an even more amazing discovery. He had found a twelve-foot-long coffin while digging a well in his courtyard. He opened the coffin and found a corpse of the same length, which he then reburied. Lichas thought about the blacksmith's story and realized that this must be Orestes, as the oracle had described. He associated the two bellows in the blacksmith's shop with the two winds, the hammer and anvil with blow upon blow, and the forging of iron with woe upon woe, considering iron as an evil discovery for humanity. Lichas returned to Sparta and informed the Lacedaemonians of his findings. The Lacedaemonians pretended to accuse Lichas of a crime and banished him. He went back to Tegea, explained his situation to the blacksmith, and tried to rent the courtyard. Although the blacksmith was initially reluctant, Lichas eventually persuaded him. Lichas then dug up the grave, collected the bones, and hurried back to Sparta with them. From that point on, the Spartans were far superior to the Tegeans in battle. By the time Croesus inquired about them, the Spartans had conquered most of the Peloponnese. 
69. Croesus, knowing all this, sent messengers to Sparta with gifts to request an alliance and instructed them on what to say. Upon arrival, they delivered the message: "Croesus, King of Lydia and other nations, has sent us with this message: 'Lacedaemonians, the god has declared that I should befriend the Greeks; now, since I understand that you are the leaders of Greece, I invite you, as the oracle suggests; I would like to be your friend and ally, without deceit or guile.'" Croesus conveyed this proposal through his messengers, and the Lacedaemonians, who had already heard about the oracle given to Croesus, welcomed the Lydians and agreed to be friends and allies. They were also grateful for the previous benefits they had received from the king. The Lacedaemonians had sent a request to Sardis to buy gold, intending to use it for the statue of Apollo that now stands on Thornax in Laconia. When they offered to buy the gold, Croesus generously gifted it to them for free. 
70. The Lacedaemonians accepted the alliance with Croesus for two reasons: they were grateful for the gold he had gifted them, and he had chosen them as friends above all other Greeks. They pledged to help him when needed and decided to give him a gift in return. They made a large bronze bowl, engraved with figures around the rim and capable of holding twenty-seven hundred gallons. However, this bowl never reached Sardis, and there are two explanations for this. The Lacedaemonians claim that while the bowl was being transported near Samos, the Samians attacked them with warships and stole it. On the other hand, the Samians say that the Lacedaemonians arrived too late and, upon learning that Sardis and Croesus had been captured, sold the bowl to some private individuals in Samos, who then placed it in the temple of Hera. It is possible that when the sellers of the bowl returned to Sparta, they reported that the Samians had robbed them. These are the stories surrounding the bowl. 
71. Croesus misunderstood the oracle's message and decided to invade Cappadocia, hoping to defeat Cyrus and the Persian power. While preparing for the attack, a wise Lydian named Sandanis, who was already well-respected, offered him some advice. He said, "O King, you are preparing to fight against people who wear leather clothes and eat whatever they have, as their land is rocky. They don't drink wine but water, and they don't have any delicious food like figs. If you win, you won't take much from them since they have so little. But if you lose, you'll lose many good things, as once they taste our luxuries, they'll hold onto them tightly. I'm grateful that the gods haven't given the Persians the idea to attack the Lydians." Despite Sandanis' words, Croesus wasn't convinced. Before conquering the Lydians, the Persians didn't have any luxuries or comforts. 
72. The Cappadocians, known as Syrians by the Greeks, were under the rule of the Medes before the Persians, and at this time, under Cyrus. The border between the Median and Lydian empires was the Halys River, which originates in the Armenian mountains and flows through Cilicia. It then flows between the Matieni on the right and the Phrygians on the left. Continuing north, the river separates the Cappadocian Syrians on the right from the Paphlagonians on the left. As a result, the Halys River forms a boundary for almost the entire lower part of Asia, from the Cyprian to the Euxine Sea. This area has the narrowest strip of land, and it takes an unburdened traveler about five days to cross it. 
73. Croesus decided to invade Cappadocia for several reasons: he wanted to expand his territory, he trusted the oracle, and he sought to avenge Astyages against Cyrus. Cyrus, the son of Cambyses, had conquered Astyages, the king of Media and Croesus' brother-in-law. Astyages was the son of Cyaxares, who was the son of Phraortes, who was the son of Deioces. A group of wandering Scythians had once separated from their tribe and entered the Median territory ruled by Cyaxares. He initially treated them kindly and even entrusted them with teaching their language and archery skills to young boys. However, one day, the Scythians returned from a hunt empty-handed, and Cyaxares, known for his temper, treated them harshly. Feeling wronged, the Scythians devised a plan for revenge. They took one of the boys they were teaching, killed him, and prepared his flesh as if it were game from a hunt. They served the boy's flesh to Cyaxares and his guests at a dinner. Afterward, the Scythians fled to seek protection from Alyattes, the son of Sadyattes, in Sardis. 
74. Alyattes refused to hand over the Scythians to Cyaxares, leading to a five-year war between the Lydians and the Medes. Both sides had their victories, and they even fought a night battle. In the sixth year, during a battle, the day suddenly turned to night. Thales of Miletus had predicted this event to the Ionians, and it happened within the year he had specified. Seeing the day turn to night, the Lydians and Medes stopped fighting and became more eager to make peace. Syennesis of Cilicia and Labynetus of Babylon helped them reconcile by arranging a marriage between Alyattes' daughter Aryenis and Astyages, the son of Cyaxares. They believed that strong bonds were necessary to ensure lasting agreements. These nations made sworn agreements similar to the Greeks, and they also had a unique ritual where they cut their arms' skin and licked each other's blood to seal the pact. 
75. Cyrus had conquered Astyages, his own grandfather, for reasons that will be explained later. This led Croesus to consult the oracles about whether he should attack the Persians. Receiving a misleading answer that he thought was favorable, Croesus led his army into Persian territory. When they reached the Halys River, they crossed it using existing bridges, as I believe. However, most Greeks think that Thales of Miletus helped the army cross the river. According to the story, since Croesus didn't know how to cross the river (as the bridges supposedly didn't exist yet), Thales, who was in the camp, came up with a solution. He dug a deep, semi-circular trench upstream from the camp, diverting the river's flow into the trench and around the camp. This caused the river to flow on both sides of the army, allowing them to ford both channels. Some even claim that the original riverbed dried up completely, but I don't believe this, as it raises the question of how they crossed the river on their return journey. 
76. Croesus led his army to a region in Cappadocia called Pteria, which was a strong part of the country and located along the line of the city of Sinope on the Euxine Sea. He set up camp there, destroyed the farms of the Syrians, and captured the city of Pteria and its surrounding areas. He also forced the Syrians from their homes, even though they had done nothing to harm him. In response, Cyrus gathered his army and marched towards Croesus, recruiting more people along the way. Before setting off, he sent messengers to the Ionians to try to persuade them to abandon Croesus, but they refused. When Cyrus finally arrived and faced Croesus in the Pterian region, their armies engaged in a fierce battle. Many soldiers on both sides were killed, and by nightfall, neither side had emerged victorious. This was how the two sides fought. 
77. Croesus was not satisfied with the size of his army, as it was much smaller than Cyrus's forces. When Cyrus did not attack again the day after the battle, Croesus decided to return to Sardis. He planned to call upon his Egyptian allies, as he had made a treaty with King Amasis of Egypt before forming an alliance with the Lacedaemonians. He also intended to seek help from the Babylonians, who were ruled by Labynetus at the time, and to set a date for the Lacedaemonians to join him. Croesus aimed to gather all these forces, along with his own army, and wait for winter to pass before marching against the Persians in early spring. With this plan in mind, he returned to Sardis and sent messengers to all his allies, asking them to meet in Sardis in five months. As for the soldiers who had fought with him against the Persians, he dismissed the mercenaries, not expecting that Cyrus would attack Sardis after such an evenly matched battle. 
78. Croesus had his own thoughts about the situation. Meanwhile, snakes started to appear in large numbers in the outskirts of the city. Seeing this, the horses left their usual grazing areas and began eating the snakes. Croesus believed this to be a bad omen, and it indeed was. He immediately sent messengers to the Telmessian interpreters to ask about the meaning of this event. Although the messengers went to the Telmessians and learned the meaning of the omen, they couldn't report back to Croesus, as he had already been captured by the time they returned to Sardis. The Telmessians had interpreted the omen as a warning that a foreign army would invade Croesus's land and conquer its people. They explained that the snake represented the land's offspring, while the horse symbolized an enemy and a foreigner. However, when the Telmessians gave this interpretation, they were not yet aware of the fate of Sardis and its king. By the time they provided their answer, Croesus had already been captured. 
79. After the battle in the Pterian region, Croesus left, planning to disband his army. Cyrus, upon learning this, realized it would be a good opportunity to quickly march against Sardis before the Lydians could regroup. He decided to act immediately, leading his army into Lydia and personally delivering the news to Croesus. Everything had gone against Croesus's expectations, leaving him in a difficult situation. Despite this, he led the Lydians into battle. At that time, the Lydians were the most courageous and skilled warriors in Asia. They fought on horseback, wielding long spears, and were highly skilled in handling horses. 
80. The two armies faced each other in a large, open plain near the city of Sardis. Several rivers, including the Hyllus, flowed across this plain and merged into the largest one, the Hermus, which originated from the sacred mountain of Mother Dindymene and emptied into the sea near the city of Phocaea. Cyrus, upon seeing the Lydians arranging their troops, became worried about their strong cavalry. At the suggestion of Harpagus, a Mede, Cyrus came up with a plan. He gathered all the camels that carried food and baggage for his army, removed their loads, and placed riders on them, equipping them like cavalrymen. He ordered these camel-mounted soldiers to advance ahead of his army against Croesus's cavalry, with the infantry following behind the camels and the rest of the cavalry behind the infantry. Cyrus instructed his troops to kill any Lydians they encountered but to spare Croesus, even if he resisted capture. Cyrus's strategy of using camels against the cavalry was based on the fact that horses are afraid of camels and cannot tolerate their sight or smell. This move was intended to neutralize Croesus's powerful cavalry, which he heavily relied upon. As the battle began, the horses indeed panicked at the sight and smell of the camels, causing Croesus's cavalry to lose its effectiveness. Despite this setback, the Lydians were brave and quickly adapted to the situation. They dismounted from their horses and fought the Persians on foot. The battle was fierce, with many casualties on both sides. Eventually, the Lydians were defeated and forced to retreat behind the walls of their city, where they were besieged by the Persian forces. 
81. The city was now under siege. Croesus, believing that the siege would last for a long time, sent messengers from the city to his allies once again. Unlike the previous envoys who had asked the allies to gather at Sardis in five months, these messengers were sent to inform them that Croesus was besieged and to urgently request their assistance. 
82. Croesus sent messages to the Lacedaemonians and other allies for help. At that time, the Spartans were in conflict with the Argives over a region called Thyrea, which was part of Argive territory that the Lacedaemonians had taken over. The Argives owned all the land to the west, up to Malea, including the mainland and the islands of Cythera and others. The Argives tried to prevent their land from being taken, and both armies agreed that 300 soldiers from each side would fight, with the winner taking the land. The rest of the armies would leave and not interfere in the battle. After the armies withdrew, the chosen soldiers fought, but neither side gained an advantage. By nightfall, only three of the 600 remained: Alcenor and Chromios from the Argives, and Othryades from the Lacedaemonians. The two Argives, thinking they had won, ran to Argos. Othryades, however, stripped the dead Argives of their weapons, took them to his camp, and stayed at his position. The next day, both armies returned to learn the outcome. They argued over who had won, with the Argives claiming they had more survivors and the Lacedaemonians pointing out that the Argives had fled while their soldier had stood his ground and stripped the enemy dead. The argument escalated into a battle, resulting in many casualties, but the Lacedaemonians ultimately emerged victorious. Following this, the Argives shaved their heads, which had previously been long, and made a law forbidding long hair and wearing gold until they regained Thyreae. The Lacedaemonians, on the other hand, made a law requiring them to wear their hair long from then on. Othryades, the sole survivor of the 300, was said to be too ashamed to return to Sparta after all his comrades had died, so he took his own life at Thyreae. 
83. The messenger from Sardis arrived to ask the Spartans for help, as Croesus was now under siege. Despite the ongoing conflict, the Spartans agreed to help and began preparing their forces and ships. However, just as they were ready to leave, a second message arrived, informing them that the Lydians' stronghold had been captured and Croesus was now a prisoner. Upon hearing this news, the Spartans, feeling very sad, decided to stop their efforts to help. 
84. Sardis was captured in the following way. After Croesus had been under siege for 14 days, Cyrus sent riders throughout his army, promising a reward to whoever first climbed the city wall. The army then attacked, but without success. However, when everyone else had given up, a Mardian named Hyroeades decided to try climbing a part of the acropolis where no guards were stationed, as nobody thought it could be taken from that side. This was because the height of the acropolis at that point was steep and seemed impossible to attack. In the past, King Meles of Sardis had carried a lion, which was born to his concubine, around the walls of the acropolis, as the Telmessians had predicted that if the lion was carried around the walls, Sardis could never be captured. However, Meles had neglected to carry the lion around this particular steep section, believing it to be unassailable. This area faced towards Mount Tmolus. The day before, Hyroeades had noticed a Lydian soldier climbing down this part of the acropolis to retrieve a fallen helmet. Observing this, he decided to attempt the climb himself, followed by other Persians. Many of them managed to climb up, and as a result, Sardis was captured and the entire city was plundered. 
85. I will now share what happened to Croesus himself. He had a son, whom I mentioned earlier, who was exceptional in many ways but could not speak. During his prosperous days, Croesus had tried everything to help his son, even consulting the oracle at Delphi. The Pythian priestess responded with this message: "Oh, Lydian king, greatly foolish Croesus, do not wish to hear the voice of your son in the palace. It is better for him to remain silent, for he will first speak on an unlucky day." During the capture of the city, a Persian soldier, unaware of Croesus's identity, approached him with the intent to kill. Croesus saw the soldier coming but, overwhelmed by the disaster, he no longer cared about his fate and was indifferent to the prospect of being killed. However, when his mute son saw the Persian approaching, fear and distress caused him to suddenly speak, shouting, "Man, do not kill Croesus!" These were his first words, and from that moment on, he was able to speak for the rest of his life. 
86. The Persians captured Sardis and took Croesus as a prisoner. He had ruled for 14 years and was besieged for 14 days. In doing so, he fulfilled the oracle's prophecy by destroying his own great empire. The Persians brought Croesus to Cyrus, who built a pyre and placed Croesus on top of it, bound in chains, along with 14 sons of the Lydians. Cyrus might have planned to sacrifice him as an offering to a god, fulfill a vow, or test if a divine power would save the pious Croesus from being burned alive. As Croesus stood on the pyre, he realized that Solon's words about no living person being fortunate were divinely inspired. He sighed deeply and, after a long silence, called out Solon's name three times. Cyrus heard this and instructed his interpreters to ask Croesus who he was calling. At first, Croesus remained silent, but eventually, under pressure, he revealed that he wished for Solon to speak with all rulers, as he had once spoken to him. His words were unclear, so the interpreters continued to question him. Croesus explained that Solon had visited him, seen his wealth, and spoken as if it meant nothing. Everything had turned out as Solon had predicted, not just for Croesus but for all people who considered themselves fortunate. As Croesus recounted this story, the pyre was lit and the flames began to spread. When Cyrus heard the interpreters' translation, he had a change of heart, realizing that he was burning another human being alive, someone who had once been as fortunate as himself. Fearing divine retribution and recognizing the instability of human affairs, he ordered his men to extinguish the fire and free Croesus and the others. However, despite their efforts, they were unable to control the flames. 
87. The Lydians say that Croesus noticed Cyrus' change of heart, and when he saw everyone trying but failing to put out the fire, he called upon Apollo. He pleaded that if he had ever given the god any pleasing gifts, Apollo should help him and save him from this terrible situation. As he cried out to the god, suddenly, clouds gathered in the clear, windless sky, a storm erupted, and heavy rain fell, extinguishing the pyre. Cyrus realized that Croesus was favored by the gods and was a good man. He had Croesus removed from the pyre and asked, "Croesus, who convinced you to wage war against my land and become my enemy instead of my friend?" Croesus replied, "O King, I did this for your benefit, but to my own misfortune. The god of the Greeks is responsible for this, as he encouraged me to wage war. No one is foolish enough to choose war over peace. In peace, sons bury their fathers, while in war, fathers bury their sons. But I suppose it pleased the divine powers for things to be this way." 
88. Croesus said this, and Cyrus freed him, allowing him to sit nearby and treating him with great care. Both Cyrus and those around him were amazed as they looked at Croesus. For a while, Croesus remained silent, lost in thought. Eventually, he turned to Cyrus and asked, "O King, should I share my thoughts with you, or keep them to myself?" When Cyrus encouraged him to speak freely, Croesus asked, "What are all those people doing over there, so busy and focused?" Cyrus replied, "They are plundering your city and taking your possessions." "No," Croesus corrected him, "not my city, and not my possessions. I no longer have any claim to all this; it is your wealth that they are pillaging." 
89. Cyrus considered Croesus' words and, asking everyone else to leave, questioned Croesus about what he thought was wrong with the current situation. Croesus, the Lydian, replied, "Since the gods have made me your servant, it's only right that I share any insights I have with you. The Persians are naturally aggressive and not wealthy. If you allow them to take and keep valuable possessions, you can expect that those who gain the most will rebel against you. So, if you agree with my suggestion, do this: Have your guards watch all the gates, and let them take the stolen goods from those who are carrying them out, saying it must be given as a tenth to Zeus. This way, you won't be hated by them for forcefully taking their wealth, and they, realizing that you're acting fairly, will willingly give up the stolen goods." 
90. When Cyrus heard this, he was extremely pleased, as he believed the advice was good. He praised Croesus greatly and instructed his guards to follow Croesus' suggestion. Then he said, "Croesus, now that you, a king, have decided to act and speak honestly, feel free to ask me for any favor you want." Croesus replied, "Master, you will make me very happy if you let me send these chains of mine to the Greek god I honored the most, and ask him if it's his nature to deceive those who serve him well."  When Cyrus asked why Croesus held a grudge against the god, Croesus told him about his own ambitions, the oracle's responses, his offerings, and how the oracle had encouraged him to attack the Persians. He then passionately requested permission to confront the god about this. Cyrus smiled and said, "I will grant you this, Croesus, and any other favor you may ever ask of me." Upon hearing this, Croesus sent Lydians to Delphi with instructions to place his chains on the temple's doorstep and ask the god if he wasn't ashamed of persuading Croesus to attack the Persians, claiming that he would destroy Cyrus' power. They were to show the chains and say that these were the first results of that power. They should also ask if being ungrateful was typical of the Greek gods. 
91. When the Lydians arrived and spoke as they had been instructed, it is said that the priestess gave the following response: "No one can escape their fate, not even a god. Croesus is paying for the sin of his ancestor, five generations back, who killed his master through a woman's deceit, even though he was part of the Heraclidae guard. He then took the royal position that he had no right to. Loxias wished that the misfortune of Sardis would fall upon Croesus' sons, not Croesus himself, but he couldn't change the Fates. However, he did manage to delay the fall of Sardis for three years, which was a favor to Croesus. So, Croesus should know that he was captured later than he was destined to be, and Loxias saved him from burning. Regarding the oracle's message, Croesus shouldn't complain. Loxias told him that if he waged war against the Persians, he would destroy a great empire. Croesus should have asked if the god was referring to his own empire or Cyrus'. But he didn't understand the message or ask for clarification, so he should blame himself. When he asked the oracle about the mule, he didn't understand that it referred to Cyrus, who was born to parents from different nations. His mother was superior, a Mede and daughter of King Astyages, while his father was a Persian, a subject of the Medes, and in all respects inferior to her." This was the priestess' answer to the Lydians. They took it back to Sardis and told Croesus. When he heard it, he admitted that the fault was not the god's, but his own. This is the story of Croesus' reign and the first downfall of Ionia. 
92. Croesus made many offerings in Greece, not just the ones I mentioned earlier. In Thebes, Boeotia, he dedicated a golden tripod to Apollo of Ismenus. In Ephesus, there are golden oxen and most of the pillars. At Delphi's temple of Proneia, there is a golden shield. All of these still existed during my time, but some other offerings were destroyed. I found out that Croesus' offerings at Branchidae of the Milesians were equal in weight and similar to those at Delphi. The offerings he made at Delphi and the shrine of Amphiaraus were from his personal wealth, inherited from his father. The rest came from the property of an enemy who had led a faction against Croesus before he became king, trying to secure the throne of Lydia for Pantaleon. Pantaleon was a son of Alyattes, and Croesus' half-brother; Croesus was born to a Carian mother, while Pantaleon had an Ionian mother. When Croesus gained power through his father's gift, he executed the man who had conspired against him by dragging him across a carding-comb. He then seized the man's property and dedicated it as I have described. This is all I will say about Croesus' offerings. 
93. In comparison to other countries, there aren't many remarkable things in Lydia, except for the gold dust that comes from Mount Tmolus. However, there is one impressive building that stands out, apart from those in Egypt and Babylon. In Lydia, you can find the tomb of Alyattes, the father of Croesus. Its base is made of large stones, while the rest is made of mounded earth. The tomb was built by market workers, craftsmen, and prostitutes. Until my time, there were five cornerstones on top of the tomb, which recorded the work done by each group. Measurements showed that the prostitutes contributed the most to the construction. All the daughters of Lydia's common people work as prostitutes to collect dowries until they can find husbands, and they offer themselves in marriage. The tomb has a circumference of 1,390 yards and a width of over 440 yards. Nearby, there is a large lake, which the Lydians say is fed by ever-flowing springs. This lake is called the Gygaean Lake. So, this is the description of the tomb. 
94. The customs of the Lydians are similar to those of the Greeks, except that they make their daughters work as prostitutes. They were the first people known to use gold and silver coins as currency and to sell goods in retail. According to the Lydians, they invented the games that are now popular among them and the Greeks during the time they colonized Tyrrhenia. Their story goes like this: During the reign of Atys, the son of Manes, there was a severe food shortage in Lydia. The Lydians tried to be patient, but the famine persisted. They came up with various solutions, and that's when they invented games like dice, knuckle-bones, ball, and other forms of games, except for dice, which they don't claim to have discovered. They used these games to distract themselves from the famine, playing all day on alternate days so they wouldn't have to search for food. On the other days, they would stop playing and eat. They lived this way for eighteen years, but the famine only worsened. Finally, their king divided the people into two groups and had them draw lots. One group would stay in the country, led by the king, while the other group, led by his son Tyrrhenus, would leave. The group that left went to Smyrna, built ships, loaded their belongings, and sailed away in search of a new home. After staying with various people, they eventually settled among the Ombrici, where they founded cities and have lived ever since. They no longer called themselves Lydians but Tyrrhenians, after the king's son who led them there. Meanwhile, the Lydians who stayed behind were eventually enslaved by the Persians. 
95. My next task in this history is to find out who Cyrus was, the person who overthrew Croesus' power, and how the Persians became the rulers of Asia. I plan to base my writing on the accounts of some Persians who want to tell the truth about Cyrus, rather than exaggerate his story. However, I could also provide three other versions of Cyrus's story if needed. After the Assyrians had ruled Upper Asia for 520 years, the Medes were the first to rebel against them. It seems that the Medes showed their courage by fighting for freedom against the Assyrians, eventually breaking free from their control. Following the Medes' example, other nations under Assyrian rule also started to revolt and gain their independence. 
96. All the people on the mainland had become free, but they eventually came under the rule of monarchs again, as I will now explain. Among the Medes, there was a clever man named Deioces, the son of Phraortes. Deioces was obsessed with the idea of becoming a ruler, so he worked towards achieving that goal. He was already a well-known figure in his town, which was one of many towns in Media. He started to practice and promote justice more consistently and passionately than before, even though there was a lot of lawlessness in Media, and he knew that injustice was always the enemy of justice. Seeing his actions, the people of his town chose Deioces to be their judge. Since he desired to become a ruler, he acted honestly and justly. This earned him a great reputation among his fellow townsmen. When people from other towns heard that Deioces was the only one giving fair judgments, as they had previously suffered from unfair decisions, they began to come to him willingly and frequently to plead their cases. Eventually, they would only accept Deioces' arbitration. 
97. The number of people coming to Deioces for judgment continued to grow, as they heard that his decisions were always in line with the truth. Seeing that everything now relied on him, Deioces decided not to sit in his usual judgment seat and announced that he would no longer give decisions. He argued that it wasn't beneficial for him to neglect his own affairs and spend all day judging other people's cases. As a result, robbery and lawlessness increased significantly in the towns. The Medes gathered to discuss their current situation, and it's likely that Deioces' friends were the main speakers. They said, "Since we can't continue living like this, let's appoint a king to rule over us. This way, our land will be well-governed, and we can focus on our own affairs without being disrupted by lawlessness." With these words, they convinced themselves to accept the rule of a king. 
98. The question immediately arose: Who should they make king? Everyone enthusiastically recommended Deioces and praised him, until they all agreed that he should be their king. He instructed them to build him a palace suitable for his royal status and provide him with a bodyguard. The Medes followed his orders, constructing a large and secure palace wherever he chose in the land, and allowed him to select a bodyguard from among the Medes. Once in power, Deioces ordered the Medes to build him a city with strong fortifications, which would be more secure than any other city. The Medes fulfilled this request as well. He built large, sturdy walls in concentric circles, which are now known as Ecbatana. The design of this fortress was such that each circle of walls was only slightly higher than the one outside it, with the difference being the height of the battlements. This was partly due to the location of the site on a hill in the plain, but mainly because of the skillful construction. There were seven circles in total; the innermost circle contained the palace and treasuries. The longest wall was about the same length as the wall surrounding the city of Athens. The battlements of the first circle were painted white, the second black, the third purple, the fourth blue, and the fifth orange. In this way, the battlements of the five circles were painted with different colors. The battlements of the last two circles were coated with silver and gold, respectively. 
99. Deioces built these walls for himself and his own living quarters, instructing the people to reside outside the wall. Once everything was constructed, Deioces established a rule that no one should enter the king's presence; instead, all communication should be done through messengers. The king should not be seen by anyone, and it would be considered disgraceful for anyone to laugh or spit in his presence. Deioces set up these precautions to ensure that the men of his own generation, who had grown up with him and were of noble birth and equal courage, would not see him and become upset or possibly conspire against him. By not seeing him, they might believe that he was somehow different from them. 
100. After establishing these rules and securing his position as the ruler, Deioces was strict in upholding justice. People would write down their legal issues and send them to him. He would then review the cases and send back his decisions. This was his method for handling legal matters, but he also had other systems in place. If he heard that someone was causing harm or committing a crime, he would summon that person and punish them according to the severity of their offense. Additionally, he had spies and informants throughout his territory to keep him informed of any wrongdoing. 
101. Deioces successfully united the Median nation and became its ruler. The Median tribes consisted of the Busae, Paretaceni, Struchates, Arizanti, Budii, and Magi. These were the various tribes that made up the Median nation. 
102. Deioces had a son named Phraortes, who took over the throne after Deioces passed away, having ruled for fifty-three years. Phraortes was not satisfied with just ruling the Medes, so he decided to attack the Persians first, making them subjects of the Medes. With the support of these two powerful nations, he went on to conquer one Asian nation after another. Eventually, he waged war against the Assyrians, specifically those who controlled Ninus. The Assyrians had once ruled over everyone, but now they were isolated, as their allies had abandoned them, although they were still prosperous. During the battle against the Assyrians, Phraortes and most of his army were killed, after he had been in power for twenty-two years. 
103. When Phraortes died, his son Cyaxares took over the throne. Cyaxares was known to be a much better soldier than his ancestors. He was the first to organize the Asian troops into separate units, such as spearmen, archers, and cavalry, instead of having them all mixed together. This king fought against the Lydians when the day turned into night during a battle, and he brought all of Asia beyond the Halys River under his control. Gathering all his subjects, Cyaxares marched against Ninus to avenge his father and destroy the city. He defeated the Assyrians in battle, but while he was besieging their city, a large army of Scythians, led by their king Madyes, son of Protothyes, attacked him. The Scythians had entered Asia after driving the Cimmerians out of Europe. Chasing them, the Scythians arrived in the Median territory. 
104. It takes a person without any baggage thirty days to travel from the Maeetian Lake to the Phasis River and the land of the Colchi. From there, it's easy to cross into Media, with only the Saspires nation in between. However, the Scythians didn't take this route; instead, they chose a longer path, keeping the Caucasian mountains to their right. In this area, the Medes confronted the Scythians, who defeated them in battle, took away their power, and gained control over all of Asia. 
105. The Scythians then set out to attack Egypt. However, when they reached the region of Syria known as Palestine, they were met by Psammetichus, the king of Egypt. He convinced them with gifts and pleas not to proceed any further, so they turned back. As they passed through the city of Ascalon in Syria, most of the Scythians didn't cause any harm, but a few stayed behind and looted the temple of Heavenly Aphrodite. Upon investigation, I found that this temple is the oldest of all the temples dedicated to the goddess. The Cyprians themselves claim that the temple in Cyprus was established based on this one, and the temple on Cythera was founded by Phoenicians from the same region of Syria. However, the Scythians who plundered the temple, as well as their descendants, were cursed by the goddess with a "female" illness. The Scythians believe that this curse is the reason for their affliction, and visitors to Scythian lands can witness the condition of those they call "Hermaphrodites." 
106. The Scythians ruled Asia for twenty-eight years, causing destruction due to their aggression and arrogance. They not only demanded tribute from each region but also roamed the land, seizing people's belongings. Eventually, Cyaxares and the Medes managed to defeat most of the Scythians by hosting feasts, getting them drunk, and then killing them. This allowed the Medes to regain their empire and reclaim all their previous territories. They also captured Ninus (which I will explain in a later part of my account) and took control of all of Assyria, except for the province of Babylon. 
107. Cyaxares passed away after ruling for forty years, including the years when the Scythians dominated. His son, Astyages, then became the ruler. Astyages had a daughter named Mandane. He had a dream in which she urinated so much that it filled his city and flooded all of Asia. Worried by this vision, he consulted the Magi who interpreted dreams. Their explanation frightened him even more. When Mandane was old enough to marry, Astyages was too afraid of the dream to marry her off to a worthy Mede. Instead, he chose a Persian named Cambyses, who was known to be well-born and had a calm nature. Astyages considered Cambyses to be of lower status than even an average Mede. 
108. During Mandane's first year of marriage to Cambyses, Astyages had another dream. He saw a vine growing from his daughter's genitals, which spread across all of Asia. He shared this vision with the dream interpreters, who told him that it meant his daughter's child would eventually take over his rule. Wanting to prevent this from happening, Astyages decided to kill the child when it was born. When Mandane gave birth to Cyrus, Astyages called upon Harpagus, a loyal servant from his household who managed all his affairs. He instructed Harpagus, "Do not fail me in this task, and do not put others before me, causing problems for yourself later. Take Mandane's child to your home, kill him, and bury him as you see fit." Harpagus replied, "My king, you have never found me displeasing in the past, and I will continue to be careful not to disappoint you in the future. If this is your wish, I will make sure to carry it out diligently." 
109. Harpagus responded in this manner, and with the child marked for death, he went home in tears. Upon arriving, he told his wife everything Astyages had said. She asked him, "What do you plan to do?" Harpagus replied, "I will not obey Astyages' orders, even if he becomes more irrational than he is now. I won't be part of this plan or help with such a murder. There are many reasons why I won't kill the child: he is related to me, and Astyages is old with no male children. If his daughter inherits the throne after his death, and he kills her son through me, I would face great danger. For my own safety, the child must die, but the murderer should be one of Astyages' own people, not mine." 
110. Harpagus quickly sent a message to one of Astyages' cowherds, named Mitradates, who was known to graze his herds in areas with many wild animals and treacherous mountains. Mitradates and his wife, Cyno, were both slaves. The mountain foothills where he grazed his cattle were located north of Ecbatana, towards the Euxine Sea. The rest of Media was mostly flat, but this area was high, mountainous, and covered in forests. When Mitradates arrived in response to the summons, Harpagus told him, "Astyages wants you to take this child and leave it in the most desolate part of the mountains, so it dies as quickly as possible. He also wants me to warn you that if you don't kill the child and instead save it, you will face a terrible death. I have been ordered to make sure the child is abandoned." 
111. Upon hearing this, the cowherd took the child and returned to his home. Coincidentally, his wife had been close to giving birth and, as fate would have it, she delivered their baby while he was away in the city. Both husband and wife were worried for each other: he was concerned about his wife's labor, and she was unsure why Harpagus had urgently summoned her husband. When he returned and appeared before her, she was surprised and asked him why Harpagus had called for him so suddenly. He replied, "Wife, when I arrived in the city, I saw and heard things I wish I hadn't. Harpagus' house was filled with tears. I went inside and saw a baby lying there, crying and dressed in gold and fine clothes. Harpagus told me to quickly take the child and leave it in the mountains where wild beasts roam. He said Astyages ordered this and threatened me if I didn't obey. So, I took the child, thinking it belonged to one of the servants, never guessing its true identity. I was shocked by the gold and clothes, and the sound of weeping in Harpagus' house. On my way back, the servant who accompanied me revealed the whole story: the child is the son of Mandane, the king's daughter, and Cambyses, the son of Cyrus. Astyages ordered the child to be killed. And now, here he is." 
112. As the cowherd spoke, he uncovered the child, revealing its beauty and fine clothes. The woman began to cry, grabbed her husband's knees, and begged him not to abandon the child. He replied that he had no choice, as spies from Harpagus would be watching, and he would face a terrible death if he disobeyed. Unable to persuade her husband, the woman proposed an alternative: "If a child must be exposed, then do this: I have also given birth, but our child was born dead. Leave our dead child in the mountains, and let's raise Astyages' daughter's child as our own. This way, you won't be caught disobeying our masters, and we won't have made a poor decision. The dead child will receive a royal burial, and the living one will be saved." 
113. Believing his wife's advice to be wise, the cowherd quickly followed her suggestion. He handed her the child he was supposed to kill and placed his own dead child in the chest, dressing it in the other child's fine clothes. He then left the chest in a desolate part of the mountains. Three days later, he asked one of his herdsmen to watch over the spot and went to the city to inform Harpagus that he could see the dead child. Harpagus sent his most trusted bodyguard, who confirmed the death and buried the cowherd's child. Meanwhile, the cowherd's wife raised the boy who would later be known as Cyrus. However, at the time, she gave him a different name. 
114. One day, when the boy was ten years old, the truth about him was revealed in the following manner. He was playing in the village where the herdsmen lived, along with other children his age. During their play, the children chose the boy, believed to be the cowherd's son, as their king. He then assigned various roles to the children: some were to build houses, some to be his bodyguards, one to be his messenger, and so on, giving each child a specific task. One of the boys playing with him was the son of Artembares, a prominent Mede. When this boy failed to complete his assigned task, Cyrus ordered the other children to seize him. They did so, and Cyrus punished the boy harshly, whipping him. The boy, deeply upset by the humiliation, went to his father in the city and complained about the treatment he had received from the son of Astyages' cowherd, not referring to him as Cyrus, as he had not yet been given that name. Artembares, equally angry, went to King Astyages with his son and reported the inappropriate behavior, saying, "O King, we have been insulted by your slave, the son of a cowherd." He then showed his son's bare, injured shoulders. 
115. Upon hearing and seeing the situation, Astyages decided to take action in light of Artembares' high status. He summoned the cowherd and his son, Cyrus. When they both arrived, Astyages looked at Cyrus and said, "You, a child of someone like this, dared to lay hands on the son of my most distinguished courtier?" Cyrus replied, "Master, I acted justly. The village boys, including him, chose me as their king during play, believing I was the most suitable. The other boys followed their assigned tasks, but this one disobeyed and showed no respect for me. That's why he received what he deserved. If I must be punished for this, I am ready to accept it." 
116. As the boy spoke, Astyages thought he recognized him. The boy's facial features resembled his own, and his confident way of speaking caught Astyages' attention. The timing of the boy's age also matched the date of the exposure. Surprised by this, Astyages remained silent for a while. When he finally regained his composure, he told Artembares that he would handle the situation fairly and sent him away. Astyages then ordered his attendants to bring Cyrus inside. Once the cowherd was alone with Astyages, the king asked him where he had found the boy and who had given him the child. The cowherd claimed that Cyrus was his own son and that the mother was still with him. Astyages warned the cowherd that he was putting himself in danger by lying and signaled his guards to seize him. Under pressure, the cowherd finally revealed the entire story, recounting every detail from the beginning. In the end, he begged the king for forgiveness. 
117. Once the cowherd revealed the truth, Astyages shifted his attention away from him and became furious with Harpagus. He ordered his guards to bring Harpagus to him. When Harpagus arrived, Astyages asked, "Harpagus, how did you kill the boy, my daughter's son, whom I entrusted to you?" Seeing the cowherd present, Harpagus decided not to lie, fearing he would be exposed. He said, "O King, when I received the boy, I thought about how to carry out your order without being seen as a murderer by your daughter or you, even though I was loyal to you. So, I did this: I called this cowherd and handed the child to him, telling him that you had ordered the child's death. And that was the truth, as it was your command. I instructed the cowherd to leave the child on a deserted mountainside, watch until the child died, and warned him of severe consequences if he failed. After he had done as instructed and the child was dead, I sent my most trusted eunuch to confirm the death and arrange the burial. This, O king, is the story, and that was the fate of the boy." 
118. Harpagus told the truth, and Astyages, concealing his anger towards him for what had happened, recounted the story as he had heard it from the cowherd. After retelling the story, Astyages revealed that the boy was alive and that everything had turned out well. He said, "I was deeply troubled by what happened to this boy, and it pained me to be at odds with my daughter. Now, in light of this fortunate turn of events, send your own son to meet this newly returned boy, and join me for dinner, as I am going to offer a sacrifice to the gods for the boy's safety and to give thanks." 
119. When Harpagus heard this, he happily went home, relieved that his actions had turned out well and that he was invited to a celebratory dinner. He told his only son, a 13-year-old boy, to go to Astyages' palace and follow the king's orders. Excited, he shared the good news with his wife. However, when Harpagus' son arrived, Astyages killed him, dismembered his body, and cooked the flesh.  At dinner time, Astyages and the other guests were served lamb, while Harpagus was unknowingly given his son's cooked flesh. The boy's head, hands, and feet were hidden in a basket. After Harpagus had eaten, Astyages asked if he enjoyed his meal. Harpagus replied, "Exceedingly." Then, the servants brought the basket containing the boy's head, hands, and feet, and told Harpagus to take what he liked. Harpagus opened the basket, saw his son's remains, but managed to stay calm. Astyages asked, "Do you know what meat you have eaten?" Harpagus replied, "I know, and everything the king does is pleasing." He took the remains and went home, likely intending to bury them. 
120. Astyages punished Harpagus in this way. To decide what to do with Cyrus, he called the same Magi who had interpreted his dream earlier. When they arrived, he asked them about their interpretation. They repeated their previous explanation, saying that the boy would have become king if he hadn't died. Astyages then told them that the boy was alive and had been made king by his village friends, assigning roles like bodyguards, messengers, and other duties. He asked the Magi what they thought about this. The Magi replied, "If the boy is alive and has already been made king without planning, then you can be sure that he won't become king again. Often, our prophecies predict small events, and the consequences of dreams may not be significant in the end." Astyages agreed, saying that he believed the dream had come true when the boy was called king and that he had nothing more to fear. However, he asked the Magi for advice on the safest course of action for his kingdom and for them. The Magi responded, "O King, we want your reign to be successful. If power shifts to the Persian boy, we Medes will be enslaved and disregarded by the Persians, as we are of different origins. But with you, our fellow countryman, as king, we have a share in power and receive great honor. So, we must protect you and your kingdom. If we saw any danger now, we would tell you. But the dream had a minor outcome, and we are confident that you should be too. As for the boy, send him away to the Persians and his parents." 
121. Upon hearing this, Astyages felt relieved and called Cyrus over. He said, "My boy, I treated you unfairly because of a meaningless dream. But fate has kept you alive. Now, go to the Persians, and I wish you good luck. I'll send guides with you. When you arrive, you'll find a father and mother who are different from the cowherd, Mitradates, and his wife." 
122. After saying this, Astyages sent Cyrus away. When he arrived at Cambyses' house, his parents welcomed him warmly, as they had believed he was dead long ago. They asked him how his life had been saved. Cyrus explained that he had been completely unaware of the truth until recently. He had thought that Astyages' cowherd was his father, but during his journey from the city, his escort had told him the whole story. He mentioned that he had been raised by the cowherd's wife and praised her highly, often speaking of Cyno. Hearing the name Cyno, his parents spread a story that Cyrus had been nursed by a dog when he was abandoned. They thought this would make the story of his survival seem even more extraordinary to the Persians. 
123. The story of Cyrus being nursed by a dog began like this. As Cyrus grew up, he became the most courageous and well-liked among his peers. Harpagus, seeking revenge on Astyages, started to befriend Cyrus and sent him gifts. Harpagus, being a private man, saw no other way to punish Astyages but to ally with Cyrus, as their misfortunes were similar. Harpagus had already convinced the leading Medes to support Cyrus as their leader and overthrow Astyages, since he was harsh towards them. With everything in place, Harpagus needed to inform Cyrus, who was living among the Persians. However, the roads were guarded, so he came up with a plan to send a message. He carefully cut open a hare's belly, placed a written note inside, and sewed it back up. He then sent the hare to Persia with his most trusted servant, who pretended to be a hunter carrying nets. The messenger was instructed to give Cyrus the hare and tell him to cut it open himself, with no one else around. 
124. Everything happened as planned. Cyrus took the hare, cut it open, and read the note inside. The message said: "Son of Cambyses, the gods are watching over you, as you have prospered. Now is the time to take revenge on Astyages, who tried to kill you. You are alive thanks to the gods and me. You must have heard the story of what happened to you and how Astyages treated me for not killing you but giving you to the cowherd. If you follow my advice, you can rule all the lands that Astyages currently governs. Encourage the Persians to rebel and lead their army against the Medes. Then, you'll get what you want, whether I am chosen to lead the army against you or another important Mede. They will naturally turn against Astyages, join you, and try to bring him down. Since everything is prepared, act quickly and follow my advice." 
125. When Cyrus read the message, he thought about the best way to convince the Persians to revolt. He decided to write a note, gather the Persians, and announce that Astyages had appointed him as the leader of the Persian armies. He then told them to come prepared with a sickle each.  There are many tribes in Persia, and the ones that Cyrus gathered and persuaded to rebel against the Medes were the Pasargadae, the Maraphii, and the Maspii. All other Persians rely on these tribes. The Pasargadae is the most important tribe, and the royal Achaemenidae clan belongs to them. The other Persian tribes include the Panthialaei, the Derusiaei, and the Germanii, who are all farmers, as well as the Dai, the Mardi, the Dropici, and the Sagartii, who are nomadic herdsmen. 
126. When everyone arrived with their sickles as instructed, Cyrus ordered them to clear a large, thorny area of land in Persia within a day. The Persians completed the task, and Cyrus then told them to clean up and return the next day. In the meantime, he gathered his father's livestock, prepared a feast for the Persians, and provided wine and other suitable foods. The next day, he had them sit and enjoy the feast in a meadow. After the meal, Cyrus asked them if they preferred their previous day's work or their current enjoyment. They replied that there was a huge difference: the previous day was full of hardship, while today was filled with pleasure. Seizing the opportunity, Cyrus revealed his plan and said, "This is your choice, Persians: follow me, and you'll enjoy these good things and many more without hard work and slavery. If you don't, you'll face countless labors like yesterday's task. So, do as I say and gain your freedom. I believe I was divinely chosen for this mission, and I consider you as capable as the Medes in war and everything else. So, let's quickly revolt against Astyages!" 
127. The Persians had long been unhappy under the rule of the Medes, and now, with Cyrus as their leader, they were eager to gain their freedom. When Astyages found out about Cyrus's actions, he sent a messenger to summon him. Cyrus replied that Astyages would see him sooner than he would like.  Upon hearing this, Astyages gathered his Medes for battle. However, he was so distracted that he forgot about his past actions towards Harpagus and appointed him as the army commander. When the Medes confronted the Persians, some fought, while others switched sides and joined the enemy, and many deliberately acted cowardly and fled. 
128. The Median army was embarrassingly defeated. When Astyages heard the news, he sent a message to Cyrus, warning him not to celebrate. He then executed the Magi who had interpreted dreams and convinced him to let Cyrus go. Afterward, Astyages gathered the remaining Medes in the city, consisting of very young and old men, and led them into battle against the Persians. However, they were defeated, Astyages was captured, and the Median army was lost. 
129. When Astyages was captured, Harpagus came to mock and taunt him. Among other cruel remarks, he reminded Astyages of the banquet where he had been served his own son's flesh and asked how it felt to be a slave after being a king. Astyages stared at Harpagus and asked, "Do you think that what Cyrus has done is because of you?" Harpagus replied, "I wrote the letter, so the success of this plan is rightfully mine." Astyages then said, "You are the most foolish and unjust man on earth. You're foolish for giving away the throne that could have been yours if this was truly your doing. You're unjust for enslaving the Medes because of that banquet. If someone else had to take the power, it should have been a Mede, not a Persian. But now, you've made the Medes, who did nothing wrong, slaves instead of rulers, and the Persians, who were once slaves, are now masters of the Medes." 
130. Astyages was removed from power after ruling for thirty-five years. The Medes had to submit to the Persians due to Astyages' cruelty. They had ruled Asia beyond the Halys River for 128 years, except for the time when the Scythians were in control. Later, they regretted their actions and rebelled against Darius, but they were defeated and brought back under control. During Astyages' time, Cyrus and the Persians revolted against the Medes and took control of Asia. As for Astyages, Cyrus didn't harm him further and allowed him to live in his own house until he passed away. This is the story of Cyrus's birth, upbringing, and rise to power. As I mentioned earlier, he conquered Croesus as punishment for the unprovoked harm done to him. After this victory, Cyrus became the ruler of all Asia. 
131. The Persians have customs that I am familiar with. They don't create statues, temples, or altars, and they consider those who do to be foolish. This is probably because they don't believe gods look like humans, as the Greeks do. Instead, they refer to the entire sky as Zeus and offer sacrifices to him on the highest mountain peaks. They also make sacrifices to the sun, moon, earth, fire, water, and winds. These have always been the only gods they worship. Later, they adopted the practice of sacrificing to the "heavenly" Aphrodite from the Assyrians and Arabians. The Assyrians call her Mylitta, the Arabians call her Alilat, and the Persians call her Mitra. 
132. This is how the Persians perform sacrifices to the gods mentioned earlier: They don't build altars, light fires, use libations, music, ribbons, or barley meal. When someone wants to make a sacrifice, they bring an animal to an open space. Wearing a wreath, usually made of myrtle, on their tiara, they call upon the god. It's not allowed for the person making the sacrifice to pray for blessings only for themselves; instead, they pray for the well-being of the king and all Persians, including themselves. Next, they cut the animal into pieces and boil the meat. They then spread soft grass, usually trefoil, and place the meat on it. A Magus, a priest, comes and sings a song about the birth of the gods according to Persian tradition. No sacrifice can be made without a Magus present. After a short time, the person making the sacrifice takes the meat and uses it as they wish. 
133. The most important day for each person is their own birthday. On this day, they believe it's appropriate to serve a larger meal than usual. Wealthy people serve whole roasted oxen, horses, camels, or donkeys, while the less fortunate serve smaller animals. Their main courses are few, but they have many desserts, which are not all served at once. This is why Persians say that Greeks leave the table still hungry because they don't have as many desserts. If Greeks had more desserts, Persians believe they would never stop eating. Persians also enjoy wine a lot. It's considered inappropriate to vomit or urinate in front of others in their culture. Additionally, they have a custom of discussing serious matters while drunk. The next day, when they are sober, the host of the gathering presents the decisions made during the drunken discussion. If they still agree with the decision while sober, they proceed with it; if not, they abandon it. If they have discussed a matter while sober, they make the final decision when they are drunk. 
134. When two men meet on the road, it's easy to tell if they are equals. If they are, they kiss each other on the lips without speaking. If there's a small difference in rank, they kiss on the cheek. If there's a significant difference, the less important person bows and shows respect to the other. Persians honor those who live closest to them the most, and then those who live slightly farther away, and so on. They believe that people who live farthest away are the least honorable because they think they are the best of all people, and others have less merit based on their distance from them. During the rule of the Medes, one tribe would govern another. The Medes had control over everyone, especially those closest to them. These tribes ruled their neighbors, who in turn ruled those next to them, following the same system the Persians use to assign honor. This allowed the nation to keep expanding its power and influence. 
135. The Persians are very open to adopting customs from other cultures. They prefer to wear the Median clothing, believing it to be more attractive than their own, and use the Egyptian armor in battle. They enjoy various forms of luxury, all of which are borrowed from other cultures. For example, they learned the practice of pederasty from the Greeks. Each Persian man has multiple legal wives and even more concubines. 
136. Being brave in battle is highly valued among the Persians, as well as having many sons. The king sends gifts every year to the man with the most sons, as they believe strength lies in numbers. Persian boys are educated from the age of five to twenty, learning only three things: horse riding, archery, and honesty. A father doesn't see his son until the boy is five years old, as he stays with the women during this time. This custom is meant to protect the father from grief if the child were to die during his early years. 
137. I admire this law, and it is indeed commendable, as it doesn't allow the king or any Persian to severely punish someone for a single mistake. Instead, they must consider the person's overall actions and only act on their anger if the wrongdoings outweigh the good deeds. The Persians claim that no one has ever killed their own father or mother. If such a crime occurs, an investigation usually reveals that the perpetrator is either a child switched at birth or born from an affair. They believe it's unthinkable for a child to kill their true parent. 
138. The Persians believe that if something is forbidden to do, it should not be spoken about either. They consider lying to be the most disgraceful act, followed by being in debt. They believe that a debtor is likely to lie as well. If a citizen has leprosy or a similar disease, they are not allowed to enter the town or interact with other Persians. They think such afflictions are a result of sinning against the sun. If a foreigner contracts such a disease, they are often expelled from the country, just as they do with white doves for the same reason. Rivers are highly respected by the Persians, and they avoid urinating, spitting, or washing their hands in them, and they don't allow others to do so either. 
139. There is an interesting observation about the Persians that we have noticed, even though they themselves may not have: their names reflect their personalities and nobility, and all end with the same letter. This letter is called "san" by the Dorians and "sigma" by the Ionians. If you look closely, you'll find that all Persian names share this common ending. 
140. I can confidently share some information about the Persians' practices regarding the dead. There are rumors that the bodies of deceased Persians are not buried until they have been torn apart by birds or dogs. I know for sure that the Magi, their religious leaders, follow this practice, as they do not hide it. It is also known that before burying the body, the Persians preserve it in wax. The Magi are quite different from the priests of Egypt and other people. While the Egyptian priests consider it a sin to kill any living being except for sacrifices, the Magi kill all creatures, except dogs and humans, with their own hands. They kill everything from ants and snakes to other crawling and flying creatures, taking pride in this act. With this understanding of their customs, I will now return to the main story. 
141. After the Persians conquered the Lydians, the Ionians and Aeolians approached Cyrus, offering to become his subjects under the same conditions they had with Croesus. Cyrus responded with a story about a flute-player who tried to lure fish from the sea with his music. When the fish didn't respond, he caught them with a net. Seeing the fish jumping, he told them it was too late to dance now since they didn't do so when he played for them. Cyrus shared this story because the Ionians, who were now willing to obey him, had previously refused his call to revolt against Croesus. Angered by this, he rejected their offer. The Ionians then fortified their cities with walls and gathered in the Panionion, except for the Milesians, who made a treaty with Cyrus on the same terms they had with the Lydians. The rest of the Ionians decided to send representatives to Sparta to seek help for their people. 
142. The Ionians had a gathering place called the Panionion, and their cities were located in areas with the most beautiful climates and seasons. The land in Ionia was unique, as it was not affected by extreme cold, wet, heat, or drought like the lands to the north or south. The Ionians spoke four different dialects. Miletus, Myus, and Priene were located in Caria and shared a common language. Ephesus, Colophon, Lebedos, Teos, Clazomenae, and Phocaea were in Lydia and had a completely different language from the first three cities. There were also three more Ionian cities: Samos and Chios, which were islands, and Erythrae on the mainland. The people of Chios and Erythrae spoke the same language, while the Samians had their own unique language. In total, there were four distinct dialects among the Ionians. 
143. Among the Ionians, the Milesians were safe from danger because they had made a treaty, and the islanders had nothing to worry about since the Phoenicians were not yet under Persian control, and the Persians were not sailors. However, the Ionians in Asia were separated from the rest in a way I will explain. At that time, the entire Greek population was small, and the Ionian branch was the least significant, with Athens being the only major city. The Athenians and others did not want to be called Ionians and rejected the name. Even today, many of them seem to be ashamed of it. However, the twelve mentioned cities took pride in the Ionian name and established a sacred place called the Panionion for themselves. They agreed not to allow any other Ionians to use it, and indeed, only the people of Smyrna requested to be admitted. 
144. In the region now known as the "Five Cities," which was once called the "Six Cities," the Dorians did not allow neighboring Dorians to enter the Triopian temple. They even banned those from their own group who had violated the temple rules. A long time ago, during the games honoring Triopian Apollo, bronze tripods were awarded to the winners. These tripods were not to be taken away from the temple but dedicated to the god there. However, a man from Halicarnassus named Agasicles ignored this rule, took the tripod, and nailed it to the wall of his house. As a punishment, the five cities - Lindus, Ialysus, Camirus, Cos, and Cnidus - prohibited the sixth city, Halicarnassus, from using the temple. This was the penalty imposed on the people of Halicarnassus. 
145. The Ionians established twelve cities and did not allow any more because, in my opinion, they had twelve divisions when they lived in the Peloponnese. There are also twelve divisions of the Achaeans who forced the Ionians out. These divisions are Pellene, which is closest to Sicyon; Aegira and Aegae, where the never-ending river Crathis flows, giving its name to a river in Italy; Bura and Helice, where the Ionians fled after losing a battle against the Achaeans; Aegion; Rhype; Patrae; Phareae; Olenus, where the large river Pirus flows; Dyme; and Tritaeae, the only inland city among them. These were the twelve divisions of the Ionians, just as they are now for the Achaeans. 
146. The Ionians created twelve cities for one reason only: they had twelve divisions in the past. It would be silly to think that these Ionians are more genuine or better born than the others. Among them are people from various backgrounds, such as Abantes from Euboea, who aren't even called Ionians, as well as Minyans from Orchomenus, Cadmeans, Dryopians, Phocian outcasts, Molossians, Pelasgian Arcadians, Dorians from Epidaurus, and many other tribes. Even those who came from Athens and believe they are the best born Ionians didn't bring wives with them to their new settlements. Instead, they married Carian women whose families they had killed. Because of this massacre, the women created a tradition and swore an oath, which they passed on to their daughters, that they would never sit at the table with their husbands or call them by their names. This was because the men had married them after killing their fathers, husbands, and sons. This event took place in Miletus. 
147. Some of the Ionians chose kings from the Lycian descendants of Glaucus, son of Hippolochus, while others chose kings from the Caucones of Pylus, descendants of Codrus, son of Melanthus. Some even chose kings from both groups. The Ionians valued their name more than the rest, so it can be said that those of pure birth are considered Ionians. All Ionians who are of Athenian descent and celebrate the Apaturia festival are also considered Ionians. However, the people of Ephesus and Colophon are the only Ionians who do not celebrate this festival. They claim that their reason for not participating is due to a certain murder-related excuse. 
148. The Panionion is a sacred place in Mykale, facing north, which was dedicated to Poseidon of Helicon by the collective decision of the Ionians. Mykale is a western part of the mainland located opposite Samos. The Ionians would gather there from their cities and celebrate a festival called Panionia. Not only do the Ionian festivals, but also all the festivals of the Greeks, end with the same letter, just like the names of the Persians. 
149. The Ionian cities are as follows, while the Aeolian cities include Cyme (also known as "Phriconian"), Lerisae, Neon Teichos, Temnos, Cilla, Notion, Aegiroessa, Pitane, Aegaeae, Myrina, and Gryneia. These are the eleven ancient Aeolian cities. However, one of them, Smyrna, was taken over by the Ionians. Just like the Ionians, the Aeolians also had twelve cities on the mainland. The Aeolians settled in an area with better land than the Ionian territory, but the climate was not as favorable. 
150. This is how the Aeolians lost Smyrna: Some men from Colophon, who were exiled due to internal conflicts, were welcomed into the city by the Aeolians. These exiles from Colophon waited until the people of Smyrna were celebrating a festival for Dionysus outside the city walls. They then closed the gates and took control of the city. In response, all the Aeolians came together to reclaim it. Eventually, an agreement was reached where the Aeolians would get their belongings back from the Ionians and leave the city. After this, the remaining eleven cities divided the people of Smyrna among themselves, making them citizens of their own cities. 
151. These are the Aeolian cities on the mainland, in addition to those located on Ida and separate from the others. Among the island cities, five of them share Lesbos (there used to be a sixth city, Arisba, but its people were enslaved by their relatives from Methymna). There is also one city on Tenedos and another in the "Hundred Isles," as they are known. The people of Lesbos and Tenedos, like the Ionian islanders, had nothing to worry about. The remaining cities discussed the situation and decided to follow the example set by the Ionians. 
152. When the representatives of the Ionians and Aeolians quickly arrived in Sparta, they chose a man from Phocaea named Pythennos to speak on their behalf. He wore a purple cloak to attract as many Spartans as possible to listen to his speech, in which he asked for help for his people. However, the Spartans didn't listen to him and refused to help the Ionians. So, the Ionians left. Even though the Spartans had rejected the Ionians' request, they still sent a group of men on a fifty-oared ship to observe the situation with Cyrus and Ionia. After arriving in Phocaea, they sent Lacrines, the most respected among them, to Sardis. There, he delivered a message from the Spartans to Cyrus, warning him not to harm any Greek cities, or else the Spartans would punish him. 
153. When the herald delivered the message, Cyrus reportedly asked the Greeks present who these Lacedaemonians were and how many of them made this declaration. After learning about them, he told the Spartan herald, "I've never been afraid of people who have a place in the center of their city where they lie and deceive each other. If I stay healthy, they'll be talking about their own problems, not the Ionians'." He made this threat against all Greeks because they have markets where they buy and sell, while the Persians didn't have markets or engage in such activities. Cyrus then left Sardis in the hands of a Persian named Tabalus and assigned a Lydian named Pactyes to manage Croesus's gold and the Lydians' wealth. He then headed to Ecbatana with Croesus, initially ignoring the Ionians. He had to deal with Babylon, the Bactrian nation, the Sacae, and the Egyptians. He planned to lead an army against these enemies himself and send another commander to fight the Ionians. 
154. As soon as Cyrus left Sardis, Pactyes led the Lydians to rebel against Tabalus and Cyrus. With all the gold from Sardis, he hired soldiers and convinced the coastal people to join his cause. Then, he marched to Sardis, trapped Tabalus in the citadel, and began a siege. 
155. While on his journey, Cyrus heard about the situation and said to Croesus, "What will be the end of this, Croesus? It seems the Lydians will never stop causing trouble for me and themselves. Maybe I should enslave them. It's like I killed the father but spared the children. I took you, who were like a father to the Lydians, and left the city to them. No wonder they're rebelling!"  Croesus, fearing that Cyrus would destroy Sardis, replied, "Your thoughts are understandable, but don't let anger take over. Don't destroy an ancient city that's innocent of past and present offenses. I'm responsible for the past and I'm being punished. Pactyes, who you left in charge of Sardis, is causing the current problem. He should pay the price. Please forgive the Lydians and give them orders that will prevent them from rebelling or being a threat. Tell them not to have weapons, make them wear tunics and knee-boots, and teach their sons music, dance, and shop-keeping. Soon, they'll become more like women than men, and you won't have to worry about them rebelling." 
156. Croesus suggested this plan because he believed it was better for the Lydians than being sold as slaves. He knew he needed a good reason to change the king's mind and worried that if the Lydians escaped this time, they might revolt later and be destroyed by the Persians. Cyrus liked Croesus' advice, calmed down, and agreed to follow it. He then called Mazares, a Mede, and told him to give the Lydians the orders Croesus had recommended. Additionally, he instructed Mazares to enslave all others who had joined the Lydians in attacking Sardis, and to capture Pactyes alive and bring him to Cyrus. 
157. While on his journey, Cyrus gave these orders and continued towards Persia. Meanwhile, Pactyes learned that an army was coming for him, so he got scared and fled to Cyme. When Mazares the Mede arrived in Sardis with his part of Cyrus' army and found Pactyes' supporters gone, he first made the Lydians follow Cyrus' commands, which changed their entire way of life. After that, he sent messengers to Cyme demanding Pactyes be handed over. The people of Cyme decided to seek guidance from the god at Branchidae to determine their course of action. There was an ancient oracle there, which all the Ionians and Aeolians used to consult. This place was located in the land of Miletus, above the harbor of Panormus. 
158. The people of Cyme went to the Branchidae oracle to ask what they should do with Pactyes in a way that would please the gods. The oracle responded that they should hand Pactyes over to the Persians. When they received this answer, they prepared to surrender him. However, Aristodicus, the son of Heraclides and a prominent citizen, didn't believe the oracle and thought that those who had consulted the god were lying. He stopped the people of Cyme from handing Pactyes over. Eventually, a second group of people, including Aristodicus, was sent to ask the oracle about Pactyes' fate. 
159. When they arrived at Branchidae, Aristodicus spoke on behalf of the group and asked the oracle, "Lord, Pactyes the Lydian has come to us seeking protection from a violent death at the hands of the Persians. They demand that we hand him over, but we fear the Persian power and haven't dared to give up our supplicant until we know clearly from you whether we should do this or not." Aristodicus asked, and the god gave the same answer again: Pactyes should be handed over to the Persians. Aristodicus then did what he had already planned. He went around the temple and removed the sparrows and all the families of nesting birds that were in it. While he was doing this, a voice (they say) came from the inner shrine, calling out to Aristodicus, "You, the worst of men, how dare you do this? Will you rob my temple of those who seek refuge with me?" Aristodicus quickly replied, "Lord, will you save your own supplicants, yet tell the people of Cyme to give up theirs?" The god answered, "Yes, I do command them, so that you may be punished all the sooner for your disrespect, and never again come to ask my oracle about giving up those who seek refuge with you." 
160. When the people of Cyme heard this response, they sent Pactyes to Mytilene, as they didn't want to face destruction for handing him over or be besieged for keeping him. Then, Mazares sent a message to Mytilene demanding Pactyes' surrender, and the people of Mytilene agreed to give him up for a price. However, the exact amount is unknown, as the deal was never completed. When the people of Cyme found out about Mytilene's plan, they sent a ship to Lesbos and took Pactyes to Chios. In Chios, Pactyes was taken from the temple of City-guarding Athena and handed over by the Chians, who received Atarneus, a district in Mysia opposite Lesbos, in return. The Persians took Pactyes and kept him under guard to show him to Cyrus later. For a long time, no one used barley meal from Atarneus for any religious sacrifices or made sacrificial cakes from its produce. Everything from that region was kept away from sacred rituals. 
161. The people of Chios handed over Pactyes, and after that, Mazares led his army against those who had helped besiege Tabalus. He enslaved the people of Priene and took control of the Maeandrus plain, allowing his army to loot it, as well as Magnesia. Shortly after these events, Mazares passed away due to an illness. 
162. Following Mazares' death, Harpagus, who was also a Mede, took over his command. This was the same Harpagus who had attended the infamous feast hosted by King Astyages of the Medes and had helped Cyrus gain the kingship. Cyrus appointed Harpagus as the new general. When Harpagus arrived in Ionia, he captured the cities using earthworks. He forced the people inside their walls and then built earthworks against the walls, which allowed him to take control of the cities. 
163. Harpagus first attacked the Ionian town of Phocaea. The Phocaeans were known for being the first Greeks to embark on long sea voyages. They discovered the Adriatic Sea, Tyrrhenia, Iberia, and Tartessus, not by sailing in round cargo ships, but in fifty-oared vessels. When they arrived in Tartessus, they befriended the local king, Arganthonius, who ruled Tartessus for eighty years and lived for a hundred and twenty. The Phocaeans gained such favor with Arganthonius that he invited them to leave Ionia and settle in his land wherever they wished. However, when he couldn't convince them to do so and learned about the growing power of the Medes, he generously provided them with money to build a wall around their city. The wall was quite impressive, as it was built with large, well-fitted stones and spanned several stades in length. 
164. The wall around Phocaea was built in this way. Harpagus attacked the city and laid siege to it, but he also offered a compromise. He said that he would be satisfied if the Phocaeans would tear down just one section of the wall and dedicate one house to him. The Phocaeans, however, were deeply offended by the idea of becoming slaves and asked for a day to think it over. They requested that Harpagus withdraw his army from the walls during this time. Harpagus knew what the Phocaeans were planning, but he agreed to let them deliberate. As soon as Harpagus moved his army away from the walls, the Phocaeans quickly launched their fifty-oared ships. They loaded their children, women, and all their valuable possessions onto the ships, along with the statues from the temples and everything inside them, except for items made of bronze, stone, or paintings. Then, the Phocaeans themselves boarded the ships and set sail for Chios, leaving their city empty. The Persians took control of the deserted Phocaea. 
165. The Phocaeans wanted to buy the islands called Oenussae from the people of Chios, but the Chians refused to sell them. They were worried that the islands would become a trading hub and their own island would lose business. So, the Phocaeans decided to sail to Cyrnus, where they had built a city called Alalia twenty years earlier, following an oracle's command. By this time, Arganthonius had passed away. Before leaving, the Phocaeans first returned to their city and defeated the Persian guards that Harpagus had placed there. They then cursed anyone who would stay behind when the rest set sail. They also threw a large piece of iron into the sea, swearing that they would not return to Phocaea until the iron reappeared. However, as they prepared to sail to Cyrnus, more than half of the citizens were overwhelmed with sadness and longing for their city and homeland. They broke their oath and sailed back to Phocaea. The remaining citizens, who kept their oath, set sail for the Oenussae islands. 
166. When the Phocaeans arrived in Cyrnus, they lived together with those who had arrived earlier and built temples there. However, they caused trouble and stole from their neighbors, which led the Tyrrhenians and Carthaginians to join forces against them. Both sides attacked with sixty ships each. The Phocaeans met their enemies in the Sardonian Sea and fought a fierce battle. Although they emerged victorious, it was a bittersweet win, as they lost forty of their ships and the remaining twenty were severely damaged, with their rams twisted out of shape. After the battle, the Phocaeans returned to Alalia, where they gathered their children, women, and as many of their belongings as their ships could carry. Leaving Cyrnus behind, they set sail for Rhegium. 
167. The Carthaginians and Tyrrhenians took the crews of the damaged ships as prisoners and drew lots to decide their fate. The majority of the prisoners were given to the people of Agylla, who then stoned them to death. However, after this event, any living being from Agylla that passed by the place where the Phocaeans were killed became twisted, crippled, and paralyzed. Seeking a solution, the people of Agylla consulted the oracle at Delphi. The priestess advised them to honor the Phocaeans, which they continue to do to this day through religious ceremonies, games, and horse races. As for the Phocaeans who escaped to Rhegium, they later moved to a city in the Oenotrian region, now called Hyele. They founded this city after learning from a man of Posidonia that the oracle's command to establish Cyrnus referred to a hero, not the island. 
168. This is what happened to the Ionian city of Phocaea. The people of Teos followed a similar path. When Harpagus captured their city by building an earthwork, they all boarded ships and sailed to Thrace. There, they established a city called Abdera, which had previously been founded by Timesius of Clazomenae. However, Timesius was forced to leave by the Thracians and didn't benefit from his efforts. Now, the people of Abdera in Teos honor Timesius as a hero. 
169. The Ionians who left their homeland did so because they couldn't bear the thought of being enslaved. The rest of the Ionians, except for the Milesians, fought bravely against Harpagus to defend their own lands. However, when they were defeated and their cities captured, they chose to stay and obey their new rulers. The Milesians, as mentioned earlier, made a treaty with Cyrus and didn't engage in any battles. This led to the second enslavement of Ionia. After Harpagus conquered the mainland Ionians, the Ionians living on the islands, fearing a similar fate, surrendered to Cyrus. 
170. When the Ionians gathered at the Panionion despite their difficult situation, Bias of Priene offered them valuable advice. If they had followed it, they could have become the most prosperous Greeks. He suggested that they all sail to Sardo and establish a single city for all Ionians. By doing so, they would control the largest island in the world, be free from slavery, and enjoy prosperity. However, if they remained in Ionia, he saw no hope for their freedom. This advice was given by Bias of Priene after the Ionians' defeat. Before the destruction, Thales of Miletus, who was of Phoenician descent, also provided good advice. He recommended that the Ionians have one central meeting place in Teos, as it was the heart of Ionia, and treat the other cities as mere districts. This was the guidance offered by both Bias and Thales. 
171. Harpagus, after conquering Ionia, led a campaign against the Carians, Caunians, and Lycians, bringing Ionians and Aeolians with him. The Carians originally lived on islands and were known as Leleges, under the rule of Minos. They didn't pay tribute but provided ships for Minos when needed. As Minos was successful in war, the Carians were highly respected at that time. They introduced three innovations that were later adopted by the Greeks: crests on helmets, designs on shields, and grips for shields. Before this, shields were held using leather belts slung around the neck and left shoulder. Much later, the Carians were forced to leave the islands by the Dorians and Ionians and settled on the mainland. The Cretans tell this story about the Carians, but the Carians themselves believe they have always lived on the mainland and have always been called Carians. They point to an ancient shrine of Carian Zeus at Mylasa as evidence. Mysians and Lydians, considered brothers of the Carians, are allowed to enter the shrine, but not those who speak the same language but belong to a different group. 
172. I believe the Caunians are native to the land, but they claim to have come from Crete. Their language is similar to the Carians, but it's unclear which influenced the other. However, their customs are quite different from the Carians and all other people. They enjoy gathering for social drinking events, organized by age and friendships, including men, women, and children. At one point, they adopted some foreign religious practices. Later, when they wanted to return to worshiping only their ancestors' gods, all adult Caunian men put on their armor and marched to the border of Calynda. They struck the air with their spears, declaring that they were expelling the foreign gods. 
173. The Lycians have an interesting history. Long ago, they came from Crete, which was not inhabited by Greeks at that time. There was a conflict between Sarpedon and Minos, sons of Europa, over the royal power in Crete. Minos won and forced Sarpedon and his followers to leave. They settled in the Milyan land in Asia, which is now Lycian territory. Back then, the Milyans were called Solymi. Sarpedon ruled the people for a while, and they were known as Termilae, a name they brought with them. Later, Lycus, the son of Pandion, arrived from Athens after being banished by his brother, Aegeus. He joined Sarpedon in the land of the Termilae, and eventually, the people were called Lycians after Lycus. Their customs are a mix of Cretan and Carian traditions, but they have one unique practice: they take their names from their mothers, not their fathers. When asked about their identity, they mention their mother and their maternal lineage. If a female citizen marries a slave, their children are still considered pure-blooded. However, if a male citizen marries a foreigner or has a child with a concubine, the children are dishonored. 
174. The Carians and Greeks living in this region didn't achieve anything significant before they were all conquered by Harpagus. Among the inhabitants were the Cnidians, who were originally from Lacedaemon. Their land, called the Triopion, was located between the sea and the Bubassus peninsula. Almost all of the Cnidian territory was surrounded by the sea, with the gulf of Ceramicus to the north and the sea near Syme and Rhodes to the south. While Harpagus was conquering Ionia, the Cnidians tried to turn their land into an island by digging a trench across a narrow strip of land, about two-thirds of a mile wide. They built a defensive barrier along this isthmus, which separated their territory from the mainland. Many people worked on this project, but they encountered more injuries than usual, especially to their eyes. So, the Cnidians sent messengers to Delphi to ask for guidance. According to the Cnidians, the priestess at Delphi responded with a verse, saying that they shouldn't build a wall or trench on the isthmus. If Zeus had wanted their land to be an island, he would have made it so. Upon hearing this response, the Cnidians stopped digging. When Harpagus arrived with his army, they surrendered without a fight. 
175. The Pedaseans lived inland, above Halicarnassus. Whenever misfortune was about to befall them or their neighbors, the priestess of Athena would grow a long beard. This had happened three times. Among the people living near Caria, the Pedaseans were the only ones who resisted Harpagus for a long time, causing him much trouble. They fortified a hill called Lide. 
176. Eventually, the Pedaseans were captured. When Harpagus led his army into the Xanthus plain, the Lycians bravely fought against them, even though they were outnumbered. However, they were defeated and forced back into their city. They gathered their families, belongings, and servants in the acropolis and set it on fire. After swearing oaths to each other, all the men of Xanthus charged out and fought until they died. Most of the people who now claim to be Lycians are of foreign descent, except for eighty households. These families happened to be away from the city at that time and survived. Harpagus conquered Xanthus and Caunus in a similar way, with the Caunians mostly following the example of the Lycians. 
177. Harpagus wreaked havoc in the lower regions of Asia, while Cyrus conquered every nation in the upper regions, not sparing any. I won't discuss most of these nations, but I will mention those that caused Cyrus the most trouble and are the most interesting to describe. 
178. After Cyrus had conquered all the mainland, he turned his attention to the Assyrians. In Assyria, there were many large cities, but the most famous and strongest was Babylon. This was where the royal residence was established after the destruction of Ninus. Babylon was an impressive city, and I will describe it as follows: Babylon was located in a vast plain and was shaped like a square, with each side being fifteen miles long. The city's total perimeter was sixty miles. No other city we know of was designed like Babylon. A deep, wide moat filled with water surrounded the city, followed by a wall that was eighty-three feet thick and three hundred thirty-three feet high. The royal measurement was three fingers' breadth larger than the common measurement. 
179. I will also explain how the earth from the moat was used and how the wall was built. As they dug the moat, they made bricks from the excavated earth. After making enough bricks, they baked them in ovens. They used hot bitumen as cement and placed layers of woven reeds every thirty rows of bricks. They built both the moat's border and the wall itself in this way. On top of the wall, they built single-room houses facing each other, with enough space in between for a four-horse chariot to pass. The wall had a hundred bronze gates, with matching bronze posts and lintels. There is another city called Is, located eight days' journey from Babylon. A small river, also named Is, flows through this city and is a tributary of the Euphrates River. Many lumps of bitumen rise with the water from the source of the river Is, and this bitumen was used for the wall of Babylon. 
180. So, the wall was built in this way, and the city was divided into two parts by the Euphrates River. This wide, deep, and fast-flowing river starts in Armenia and ends in the Red Sea. The wall's corners on both sides were built right up to the river, where they turned and continued as a fence made of baked bricks along each riverbank. The city was filled with three and four-story houses, and the streets that crossed it, both those running parallel to the river and the others, were all straight. At the end of each street, there was a gate in the riverside fence, one for each street. These gates were also made of bronze and opened onto the river. 
181. The city had outer walls that served as its protection. Inside these walls, there was another, slightly smaller wall that was almost as strong. In one part of the city, there was a royal palace surrounded by a tall and sturdy wall. In the other part, there was a sacred area dedicated to Zeus Belus, which was a square measuring four hundred and forty yards on each side and had bronze gates. In the center of this sacred area, a solid tower was built, measuring two hundred and twenty yards in length and width. On top of this tower, another one was built, and then another, until there were eight towers in total. A spiral path led up the towers from the outside, with a resting place and seats halfway up for people to sit and rest during their climb. The last tower had a large shrine with a well-covered couch and a golden table nearby. However, there was no statue in the shrine, and no one was allowed to spend the night there, except for one local woman chosen by the god, as the Chaldaeans (priests of this god) claimed. 
182. The Chaldaeans claim (though I find it hard to believe) that the god himself visits the shrine and rests on the couch, just like in Thebes, Egypt. The Egyptians say that a woman also sleeps in the temple of Theban Zeus, and neither the Egyptian nor the Babylonian woman is said to have any relations with men. Similarly, the prophetess of the god at Patara in Lycia follows this practice when she is chosen. There isn't always a place for divination there, but when the prophetess is selected, she stays in the temple overnight. 
183. In the Babylonian temple, there is another shrine located below the main one. Inside, there is a large golden statue of Zeus sitting at a huge golden table, with a golden footstool and chair. The Chaldaeans say that the total weight of the gold is eight hundred talents. Outside the temple, there is a golden altar, as well as a larger altar where adult animals from the flocks are sacrificed. Only young animals can be sacrificed on the golden altar. The Chaldaeans offer a thousand talents' weight of frankincense on the larger altar every year during the god's festival. During the time of Cyrus, there was a twenty-foot-high solid gold statue in the sacred area. I haven't seen it myself, but I'm sharing what the Chaldaeans have told me. Darius, the son of Hystaspes, wanted to take the statue but didn't dare to. His son, Xerxes, took it and killed the priest who warned him not to move the statue. This is what the temple contains, along with many other private offerings. 
184. In the history of Babylon, there were many rulers who completed the construction of the city's walls and temples. Among them, two were women. The first woman, named Semiramis, lived five generations before the second one. She was known for building dikes on the plain, which was a remarkable achievement. Before she built the dikes, the entire plain would often get flooded by the river. I will mention more about these rulers in my Assyrian history. 
185. The second queen of Babylon, Nitocris, was even wiser than the first. She left behind impressive monuments and took measures to protect her city. Aware of the growing power of the kingdom of Media and the fall of other cities like Ninus, she prepared for potential threats. First, she modified the Euphrates River, which flowed through the center of Babylon. Originally straight, she dug canals further upstream to make the river so winding that it now passes an Assyrian village called Ardericca three times. As a result, travelers sailing from our sea to Babylon must spend three days navigating the winding Euphrates, passing the same village three times. In addition to this, she built a massive embankment along both shores of the river. Far above Babylon, she also dug a reservoir for a lake, slightly away from the river. She dug deep enough to find water and made the lake's circumference fifty-two miles long. The excavated soil was used to further embank the river's edges, and she built a stone quay around the entire lake. The purpose of these changes was to slow down the river's current with its many twists and turns, making the passages to Babylon more difficult to navigate. This also created a long detour around the lake. All this work was done in the part of the country where the passes were shortest from Media, preventing the Medes from easily interacting with her people and learning about Babylon's affairs. 
186. Nitocris made the deep river her protection, and this led to another project. The river divided her city into two parts, and in the past, people had to use boats to cross from one side to the other, which was likely inconvenient. The queen found a solution for this issue, creating another impressive feature during her reign. When the digging of the lake basin was completed, she prepared long blocks of stone. With these ready and the place dug, she redirected the river into the basin. While it was filling up and the original riverbed was dry, she used baked bricks to line the river's edges within the city and the path from the gate leading down to the river. These bricks were similar to those used for the city walls. Near the middle of the city, she built a bridge using the excavated stones, binding them together with iron and lead. Each morning, she placed square-cut logs across the bridge for the Babylonians to cross. However, these logs were removed at night to prevent people from constantly crossing and stealing from one another. Once the lake basin was filled by the river and the bridge was completed, Nitocris redirected the Euphrates back to its original channel, draining the lake. In doing so, she achieved her goal of creating a swamp-like basin for protection, while also providing her citizens with a convenient bridge. 
187. This same queen, Nitocris, also came up with a clever trick. She had a tomb built for herself, placed high above the city's most frequently used entrance gate. On the tomb, she had an inscription engraved, which read: "If any future king of Babylon needs money, let him open this tomb and take as much as he wants. But he should not open it unless he truly needs it, as it will bring him misfortune." The tomb remained untouched until Darius became king. He found it strange that he never used this gate or took the money, even though the inscription invited him to do so. He avoided using the gate because he didn't want to pass under the dead body. Eventually, Darius opened the tomb, but instead of finding money, he only found the dead body and another inscription that read: "If you had been content with what you had and not disgraced yourself seeking more, you would not have opened the coffins of the dead." This story illustrates the cunning nature of Queen Nitocris. 
188. Cyrus decided to wage war against Nitocris' son, who inherited both the name Labynetus and the rule of Assyria from his father. When the Great King went on a campaign, he always brought plenty of food and livestock from his homeland. He also carried water from the Choaspes River, which flowed past the city of Susa, as it was the only water he would drink. The water from the Choaspes River was boiled, and numerous four-wheeled wagons, pulled by mules, transported it in silver containers. These wagons followed the king wherever he went, ensuring he always had access to his preferred water. 
189. During Cyrus' march to Babylon, he reached the Gyndes River, which originated in the Matieni mountains and flowed through the Dardanean region into the Tigris River. The Tigris then passed the city of Opis and emptied into the Red Sea. As Cyrus attempted to cross the Gyndes, which was navigable at that point, one of his sacred white horses tried to pass through the river but was swept away by the strong current. Cyrus became very angry at the river's force and threatened to weaken it so that women could easily cross it without even wetting their knees. Instead of continuing his march to Babylon, he divided his army into two parts and planned out 180 canals branching out from both banks of the Gyndes. He then organized his army along these lines and instructed them to dig. With a large number of people working on the project, progress was fast, but it still took the entire summer to complete. 
190. At the beginning of the next spring, after Cyrus had divided the Gyndes River into 360 canals as punishment, he finally marched towards Babylon. The Babylonians came out to confront him, and when he approached their city, they fought against him. However, they were defeated and forced to retreat back into the city. They had already stored enough provisions to last for many years, as they were aware of Cyrus' ambitious nature and his attacks on all nations. Thus, they were not worried about the siege. Cyrus, on the other hand, was unsure of what to do next, as he had been delayed for a long time and had not made any significant progress. 
191. I am not sure if someone advised him or if he figured it out himself, but Cyrus came up with a plan. He positioned his army where the river entered the city and another part where the river exited the city. He instructed his men to enter the city through the Euphrates River channel when it became shallow enough to cross. After giving these orders, he marched away with the non-fighting members of his army. When he reached the lake, Cyrus diverted the river into the lake, which was a marsh, causing the water level in the river to drop until it was shallow enough to cross. The Persians, who were waiting for this moment, entered Babylon through the Euphrates channel, which was now only about thigh-deep. If the Babylonians had known or discovered Cyrus' plan, they could have trapped and destroyed the Persians by closing the gates along the river and guarding the walls along the riverbanks. However, the Persians caught them by surprise. Due to the city's large size, the people in the outer parts were defeated, while those in the middle were unaware of the attack. They were busy dancing and celebrating a holiday that happened to occur at that time. Eventually, they learned the unfortunate truth. 
192. Babylon was captured for the first time in this manner. Its immense power can be demonstrated in various ways, especially through its resources. The great King divides his land to provide for himself and his army, and also collects tribute. Babylon's territory alone supports him for four months of the year, while the rest of Asia provides for the remaining eight months. This means that Assyria's wealth accounts for one-third of Asia's total wealth. The governorship of this land, which the Persians call "satrapy," is the most powerful of all. Tritantaechmes, the son of Artabazus, was appointed by the king to govern this province, and his daily income was an artaba full of silver (an artaba is a Persian measure, slightly larger than an Attic medimnus). In addition to warhorses, he had 800 stallions and 16,000 brood mares in his stables, with each stallion servicing 20 mares. He also kept a large number of Indian dogs, and four major villages in the plain were assigned to provide food for these dogs, exempting them from other duties. Such was the wealth of the governor of Babylon. 
193. In Assyria, there is not much rain. The little rain that falls helps the grain to grow, but it is the irrigation from the river that ripens the crops and brings them to fullness. Unlike Egypt, where the river floods the fields, in Assyria, the fields are watered by hand and using swinging beams. The entire land of Babylon, similar to Egypt, is crisscrossed by canals. The largest of these canals is navigable and connects the Euphrates River to the Tigris River, where the city of Ninus once stood. Babylon is the most fertile land for growing grain that we know of. It does not produce trees like fig, vine, or olive, but the grain is so abundant that it usually yields two hundred times its amount, and even three hundred times during the best harvests. The wheat and barley stalks are easily four fingers wide. I won't mention how tall the millet and sesame plants grow, as I know that even what I've said about the grain might not be believed by those who have never been to Babylonia. The people of Babylon use sesame oil instead of other oils. There are palm trees all over the plain, with most of them bearing fruit that is used to make food, wine, and honey. The Assyrians take care of these trees like they do with fig trees. They tie the fruit of the male palm trees to the date-bearing palm trees, allowing the gall-fly to enter the dates and help them ripen. This also prevents the palm fruit from falling, as the male palms have gall-flies in their fruit, similar to unripened figs. 
194. I want to share what I think is the most amazing thing in this country, besides the city itself. The boats that travel on the river to Babylon are made of skins and are round. These boats are made in Armenia, further upstream than Assyria. First, they create frames from willow branches, then cover them with stretched hides, creating a sort of hull. The boats are round, like a shield, with no distinct front or back. They fill the boats with reeds and load them with cargo, mostly palm wood casks of wine, and send them floating down the river. Two men stand up to steer the boat using paddles, one pulling and the other pushing. These boats come in various sizes, with the largest ones able to carry up to five thousand talents of weight. Each boat has at least one live donkey on board, with more on the larger boats. When they reach Babylon and sell their cargo, they also sell the boat's frame and reeds. The hides are then placed on the donkeys' backs, and they are driven back to Armenia. It's not possible to travel upstream by water due to the strong current, which is why they make their boats from hides instead of wood. Once the donkeys return to Armenia, they make more boats in the same way. 
195. Their boats are quite unique. As for clothing, they wear a long linen tunic that reaches their feet. Over this, the Babylonians put on another woolen tunic and wrap themselves in a white cloak. They wear their traditional shoes, which resemble Boeotian sandals. They keep their hair long and cover it with caps, and they perfume their entire body. Each person carries a seal and a carved staff, which has an image on it, like an apple, a rose, a lily, or an eagle. No one carries a staff without an image on it. 
196. The people have their own unique attire and customs. One of their wisest customs, which I found out is also practiced by the Eneti in Illyria, is the following: Once a year, in every village, all the young women of marriageable age were gathered in one place, surrounded by a crowd of men. A crier would then present and auction off each woman, starting with the most beautiful. After the most attractive women were sold as lawful wives, the less attractive and disabled ones were offered along with money to those who were willing to marry them. The money came from the sale of the more attractive women, who essentially paid the dowry for the less fortunate ones. Rich Assyrian men who wanted to marry would compete for the most beautiful women, while ordinary men who didn't care about beauty could marry the less attractive ones and receive money as well. However, a father couldn't choose who his daughter would marry, and the buyer had to promise to actually marry the girl he bought. If the couple couldn't get along, the money had to be returned. Men from other villages were also allowed to buy brides if they wanted. This was considered their best custom, but it doesn't continue today. Since the conquest of Babylon left them in poverty, those who can't make a living have resorted to prostituting their daughters. 
197. Now, let's talk about another wise custom they have: Instead of relying on doctors, they bring the sick to the marketplace. People who have experienced the same illness or have seen others with the same condition come forward to offer advice and comfort. They share how they or others have recovered from the illness. It's important to note that no one is allowed to walk past the sick person without asking about their health and offering help. 
198. When someone dies, their body is preserved in honey for burial, and their funeral songs are similar to those of Egypt. After a Babylonian couple has been intimate, they both sit in front of burning incense. They only wash themselves at dawn, and until then, they don't touch any objects. This custom is also followed in Arabia. 
199. There is a very unpleasant Babylonian custom that requires every woman in the land to visit the temple of Aphrodite and have a one-time intimate encounter with a stranger. Wealthy and proud women who don't want to mix with others arrive at the temple in covered carriages with a large group of attendants. However, most women sit in the sacred area of Aphrodite's temple, wearing crowns made of cord on their heads. There are many women coming and going, with paths marked for men to walk through and choose a woman. A woman must stay at the temple until a stranger gives her money and has an intimate encounter with her outside the temple. While giving the money, the man must say, "I invite you in the name of Mylitta" (which is the Assyrian name for Aphrodite). The woman cannot refuse the money, as it becomes sacred through this act. She must follow the first man who gives her money and cannot reject anyone. After the encounter, she returns home, having fulfilled her sacred duty to the goddess. From then on, no amount of money can persuade her to do it again. Beautiful and tall women can leave the temple quickly, but less attractive women may have to wait longer to fulfill the law. Some of them stay for three or even four years. A similar custom exists in some parts of Cyprus. 
200. These are some of the traditions followed by the Babylonians. In addition, there are three tribes in the country that only eat fish. They catch the fish and dry it under the sun. Afterward, they put the dried fish in a mortar, crush it with a pestle, and then pass it through a linen cloth. Some people make a sort of cake from the crushed fish and eat it, while others bake it like bread. 
201. After conquering this nation, Cyrus wanted to conquer the Massagetae as well. They are believed to be a strong and influential people living in the east, where the sun rises, beyond the Araxes River and across from the Issedones. Some even say that they are a part of the Scythian people. 
202. Some people say that the Araxes River is larger than the Ister, while others believe it's smaller. It is said to have many islands, as big as Lesbos, with people living on them. In summer, these people eat various roots they dig up, and in winter, they eat stored fruits from trees. They also know about a fruit that, when thrown into a fire, produces fumes that make them as drunk as Greeks get from wine. As more fruit is added to the fire, they become even more intoxicated, eventually dancing and singing. The Araxes River flows from the land of the Matieni, just like the Gyndes River, which Cyrus divided into 360 channels. The Araxes empties itself through forty mouths, with all but one leading to marshes and swamps. It is said that people living there eat raw fish and wear sealskin clothing. The remaining stream of the Araxes flows clearly into the Caspian Sea, which is a separate sea and not connected to the other seas. The sea that the Greeks sail on, the sea beyond the Pillars of Heracles, which they call the Atlantic, and the Red Sea are all part of the same body of water. 
203. The Caspian Sea is separate and unique. It takes fifteen days for a rowed ship to travel its length, and its widest point can be crossed in eight days. The Caucasus mountain range, with more and taller peaks than any other, stretches along its western shore. Many diverse nations live in the Caucasus, and most of them rely on the forest's fruits for sustenance. It is said that there are trees here with leaves that can be crushed and mixed with water to create a paint for decorating clothes. These designs don't wash out and last as long as the fabric itself, as if they were woven in from the beginning. People in this region, it is said, engage in intimate relationships openly, much like animals. 
204. The Caspian Sea is bordered to the west by the Caucasus Mountains. To the east, a vast, seemingly endless plain stretches out from its shores. Most of this expansive plain is the land of the Massagetae, whom Cyrus was eager to conquer with his army. Several significant factors motivated and encouraged him to do so: firstly, his extraordinary birth, which made him appear more than human; and secondly, his victories in previous battles, as no nation he had attacked had ever escaped his grasp. 
205. During this time, the Massagetae were led by a queen named Tomyris, who was a widow. Cyrus sent her a message pretending to want her as his wife, but Tomyris saw through his deception, realizing that he was after her kingdom, not her. When his trickery failed, Cyrus marched to the Araxes River and openly prepared to attack the Massagetae. He built bridges for his army to cross the river and constructed towers on the floating platforms supporting the bridges. 
206. While Cyrus was occupied with his preparations, Tomyris sent a messenger to him with a message: "O King of the Medes, slow down and consider whether completing this task will truly benefit you. Rule your own country and let us govern ours. However, if you insist on conflict rather than peace, and you're eager to test the strength of the Massagetae, stop building the bridge and let us move three days' journey away from the Araxes River. After that, you can cross into our land. Alternatively, if you'd rather have us enter your territory, you can withdraw as I suggested." Upon hearing this, Cyrus gathered the Persian leaders and discussed the matter with them, seeking their advice on which option to choose. They all agreed on one thing: to let Tomyris and her army enter Cyrus's territory. 
207. Croesus, the Lydian, who was present, disagreed with their advice and spoke against it. "O King," he said, "since Zeus has given me to you, I will do my best to prevent any misfortune that threatens your kingdom, as I have learned from my own disasters. If you believe that you and your army are immortal, then my advice is unnecessary. But if you recognize that you and your subjects are only human, then let me teach you this: people's fortunes are like a wheel that constantly turns, not allowing anyone to prosper forever. With this in mind, I don't share the same opinion as your other advisors regarding this matter. If we allow the enemy to enter your land, you risk losing both the battle and your empire. If the Massagetae win, they will not retreat but will advance into your provinces. However, if you defeat them, it's a lesser victory than if you crossed into their territory, defeated the Massagetae, and pursued them. I believe that after defeating your adversaries, you will march towards Tomyris' power base. Moreover, it would be shameful and unacceptable for Cyrus, the son of Cambyses, to yield and retreat before a woman. I suggest that we cross the river and advance as far as the enemy withdraws. Then, we should try to overcome them by following my plan. As far as I know, the Massagetae have never experienced the luxuries of Persia and have never enjoyed the finer things in life. Therefore, I advise you to prepare a feast in our camp with generous portions of meat from your sheep and goats, along with many bowls of undiluted wine and various types of food. Afterward, let your army retreat to the river, leaving behind the least valuable part of it. If my judgment is correct, the Massagetae will be drawn to the feast, indulging themselves in the food and drink. This will provide us with the opportunity to achieve great things." 
208. The two opinions conflicted, and Cyrus decided to abandon his initial plan in favor of Croesus's suggestion. He informed Tomyris that he would cross the river and attack her, so she withdrew her army as she had previously promised. Cyrus then entrusted Croesus to his son Cambyses, who would inherit his kingdom, instructing him to honor and treat Croesus well if the battle against the Massagetae didn't go as planned. After giving these instructions, Cyrus sent the two back to Persia, and he and his army crossed the river. 
209. After crossing the Araxes River, Cyrus had a dream while sleeping in the Massagetae territory. He saw the eldest son of Hystaspes with wings on his shoulders, one wing covering Asia and the other covering Europe. Hystaspes, son of Arsames, was an Achaemenid, and his eldest son, Darius, was about twenty years old. Darius had stayed behind in Persia since he was too young to join the campaign.  Upon waking up, Cyrus thought about his dream and believed it to be significant. He called for Hystaspes and spoke to him privately, saying, "Hystaspes, I believe your son is plotting against me and my rule. I know this because the gods watch over me and reveal future events to me. In my dream, I saw your eldest son with wings on his shoulders, covering both Asia and Europe. This vision convinces me that he is conspiring against me. So, return to Persia quickly, and when I come back after conquering this land, bring your son to me so I can question him about this." 
210. Cyrus believed that Darius was conspiring against him, but in reality, the dream was a sign that Cyrus would die in the land he was in, and Darius would inherit his kingdom. In response to Cyrus's concerns, Hystaspes said, "O King, I hope no Persian would ever plot against you. If there is one, may they be swiftly destroyed, for you have transformed the Persians from slaves to free men and from subjects to rulers. However, if your dream truly indicates that my son is planning a revolt, I give you full authority to deal with him as you see fit." 
211. After giving his response, Hystaspes crossed the Araxes River and went to Persia to keep an eye on his son for Cyrus. Meanwhile, Cyrus followed Croesus's advice and marched a day's journey from the Araxes. Cyrus and the main part of the Persian army returned to the Araxes, leaving behind the less capable soldiers. A third of the Massagetae forces attacked the remaining Persian soldiers, defeating them despite their resistance. After their victory, the Massagetae enjoyed the feast that had been prepared, indulging in food and wine until they fell asleep. The Persians then launched a surprise attack on the sleeping Massagetae, killing many and capturing even more, including Tomyris's son, Spargapises, who was the leader of the Massagetae. 
212. When Tomyris learned about the fate of her army and her son, she sent a messenger to Cyrus with this message: "Cyrus, who always thirsts for blood, don't be proud of what you've done. It's not an achievement to have tricked my son with wine, causing him to lose control and be captured, rather than defeating him in a fair battle. Now, listen to my advice: return my son to me and leave our land without punishment, even though you've harmed a third of the Massagetae army. If you refuse, I swear by the sun, the lord of the Massagetae, that I will make sure you get more than enough of the blood you crave." 
213. Cyrus ignored the warning when it was relayed to him. Meanwhile, Spargapises, Queen Tomyris's son, sobered up and realized the terrible situation he was in. He asked Cyrus to release him from his chains, and Cyrus agreed. However, as soon as Spargapises was free and able to use his hands, he took his own life. 
214. Spargapises met his end in this manner. When Cyrus refused to listen to Tomyris, she gathered all her forces and engaged him in battle. This fight is considered to be one of the fiercest ever fought between non-Greek men, and I have learned that this was indeed the case. At first, they shot arrows at each other from a distance. When their arrows were used up, they charged at each other, fighting with spears and swords. They fought for a long time, neither side giving up ground, until the Massagetae eventually gained the upper hand. Most of the Persian army was killed on the battlefield, and Cyrus himself died there, having ruled for just one year short of thirty years. Tomyris filled a skin with human blood and searched for Cyrus's body among the Persian dead. When she found it, she shoved his head into the blood-filled skin and taunted the dead man, saying, "Even though I am alive and have defeated you in battle, you have destroyed me by deceitfully capturing my son. But as I promised, I now give you your fill of blood." There are many stories about Cyrus's death, but the one I have told is the most believable. 
215. The Massagetae people have a similar dress and lifestyle to the Scythians. They have both cavalry and infantry, including spearmen and archers, and they often carry battle-axes. They use gold and bronze for their weapons and decorations; their spear-points, arrow-heads, and battle-axes are made of bronze, while their headgear, belts, and girdles are adorned with gold. Their horses are also equipped in a similar manner, with bronze breastplates for protection and gold on the reins, bits, and cheekplates. They don't use iron and silver because these metals are not found in their country, but gold and bronze are plentiful. 
216. As for their customs, each man has a wife, but the wives are shared among all men. The Greeks believe this is a Scythian practice, but it is actually a Massagetae custom. When a man is interested in a woman, he hangs his quiver in front of her wagon and then sleeps with her without any fear. The Massagetae don't have a fixed lifespan, but when a man becomes very old, his family gathers together to kill him along with some livestock. They then cook the meat and have a feast. This is considered the best way to die. If someone dies from an illness, they don't eat the body but bury it in the ground, mourning that the person didn't live long enough to be killed in the traditional way. The Massagetae don't grow crops; they rely on their livestock and the fish they catch in abundance from the Araxes River for food. They drink milk as their main beverage. They worship only the sun as their god and offer horse sacrifices to it. They believe the sun is the fastest of the gods, so they give it the fastest of mortal creatures as a tribute.
