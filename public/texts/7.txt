1. When Darius, the son of Hystaspes, heard about the battle at Marathon, he became even angrier with the Athenians. They had already attacked Sardis, and now he was determined to send an army against Greece. He quickly ordered all the cities to prepare for war, telling them to gather more ships, horses, supplies, and transport vessels than ever before. For three years, Asia was busy with these preparations, as the best soldiers were chosen to fight against Greece. In the fourth year, the Egyptians, who had been enslaved by Cambyses, rebelled against the Persians. This made Darius even more eager to send armies against both Greece and Egypt. 
2. While Darius was planning attacks on Egypt and Athens, a big argument broke out among his sons about who should be the main leader in the country. They believed that before the army left, Darius needed to name his successor according to Persian law. Darius had three sons with his first wife, Gobryas' daughter, and four more sons with his second wife, Atossa, who was Cyrus' daughter. Artobazanes was the oldest son from the first marriage, and Xerxes was the oldest from the second. Since they had different mothers, they were competing against each other. Artobazanes claimed that he should be the ruler because he was the oldest of all Darius' children, and it was common for the oldest child to take charge. Xerxes argued that he should be the leader because his mother was Cyrus' daughter, and Cyrus was the one who had given the Persians their freedom. 
3. While Darius was taking his time to decide, Demaratus, the son of Ariston, happened to be in Susa. He had left Sparta willingly after losing his kingship. When he heard about the disagreement between Darius' sons, he decided to give Xerxes some advice. He suggested that Xerxes should point out that he was born when Darius was already king, while Artobazanes was born when Darius was still a subject. Therefore, it wouldn't be fair for anyone else to become king before Xerxes. Demaratus also mentioned that in Sparta, if a son was born after the father became king, that son would inherit the kingship. Xerxes followed this advice, and Darius agreed that it was a fair argument, so he named Xerxes as the king. However, it's likely that Xerxes would have become king anyway, since his mother Atossa had a lot of influence. 
4. After naming Xerxes as king, Darius focused on his planned attacks. However, a year later, during the preparations and after Egypt's rebellion, Darius passed away. He had ruled for a total of thirty-six years, and he never got the chance to take revenge on the Egyptians or the Athenians. 
5. After Darius' death, his son Xerxes became the ruler. At first, Xerxes didn't want to attack Greece; instead, he gathered his army to fight against Egypt. However, Mardonius, Xerxes' cousin and the son of Darius' sister, had a lot of influence on him. Mardonius insisted that the Athenians should be punished for the harm they had caused the Persians. He suggested that Xerxes should first deal with Egypt and then lead his armies against Athens. This way, Xerxes would gain a good reputation, and others would think twice before invading his kingdom in the future. Mardonius also mentioned that Europe was a beautiful land with many fruit trees and was a perfect place for a king to rule. 
6. Mardonius wanted to have adventures and become the governor of Greece. Eventually, he convinced Xerxes to follow his plan. Other events also helped persuade Xerxes. Messengers from Thessaly, the Aleuadae family who were rulers there, eagerly invited the king to invade Greece. The Pisistratidae, who had come to Susa, made the same request, promising even more support. They were accompanied by Onomacritus, an Athenian fortune-teller who had organized the prophecies of Musaeus. Despite their past conflicts, they had reconciled. Onomacritus had been expelled from Athens by Pisistratus' son, Hipparchus, after being caught adding false predictions to Musaeus' writings. However, they had been close friends before that incident. Now in Susa with the Pisistratidae, Onomacritus would recite prophecies to the king. He chose only the favorable ones, such as the need for a Persian to build a bridge across the Hellespont and the description of the invasion. He avoided mentioning any predictions of disaster for the Persians. With the help of these prophecies and the support of the Pisistratidae and Aleuadae, Xerxes was persuaded to invade Greece. 
7. After deciding to attack Greece, Xerxes first focused on the rebels a year after Darius' death. He defeated them and imposed a much harsher slavery on Egypt than during Darius' time. He then put his own brother, Achaemenes, who was also Darius' son, in charge of Egypt. Later on, Achaemenes was killed by a Libyan named Inaros, the son of Psammetichus. 
8. After conquering Egypt, Xerxes planned to attack Athens. He gathered the most important Persians to discuss their opinions and share his intentions. Xerxes told them that he wanted to continue the tradition of expanding their empire, just like his predecessors, Cyrus, Cambyses, and his father Darius. He believed that by attacking Athens, they could gain more land, seek revenge, and increase their power. Xerxes explained that he planned to build a bridge across the Hellespont and lead his army through Europe to Greece. He wanted to punish the Athenians for the harm they had caused to the Persians and his father. He reminded them of the previous attacks on Sardis and the battles led by Datis and Artaphrenes. Xerxes believed that if they defeated the Athenians and their neighbors, the Persian territory would expand to the edge of the sky. They would conquer all of Europe, leaving no one to challenge them. Both guilty and innocent people would become their slaves. Xerxes asked the Persians to come prepared when he called for them, promising rewards for the best-equipped armies. He also encouraged them to share their opinions on the matter. With that, Xerxes finished speaking. 
9. After Xerxes spoke, Mardonius said, "Master, you are greater than any Persian who has ever lived or will live. You are right not to let the Greeks in Europe mock us. It would be strange if we, who have conquered and enslaved many powerful nations to increase our power, don't take revenge on the Greeks for their unprovoked actions. What do we have to fear from them? Do they have a large population or wealth? We know how they fight and how weak they are. We have already conquered their people, like the Ionians, Aeolians, and Dorians. I have experienced their weakness when your father ordered me to march against them. I went as far as Macedonia, almost reaching Athens, but no one came to fight me. The Greeks have a strange way of fighting. They choose the most beautiful and flat land to fight on, causing great harm to the winners and complete destruction to the losers. They should resolve their disputes through messengers or other peaceful means since they speak the same language. If they must fight, they should choose their strongest positions. But when I marched to Macedonia, they didn't even think about fighting. Who will dare to fight against you, O king? You will bring the vast armies of Asia and all your ships. I don't think the Greeks are bold enough to face us. But if I'm proven wrong and they do fight, they will learn that we are the greatest warriors on earth. Let's try everything, for nothing happens on its own, and all success comes from taking risks." 
10. Mardonius finished speaking, and the other Persians remained silent, not daring to disagree. Then Artabanus, Xerxes' uncle, spoke up. He said that it's important to hear different opinions to make the best decision, just like comparing gold to find the purest one. He reminded Xerxes that he had advised Darius not to attack the Scythians, but Darius didn't listen and lost many soldiers. Artabanus warned Xerxes that he was planning to attack much stronger people than the Scythians, who were skilled in both land and sea battles. He pointed out the potential dangers of Xerxes' plan to build a bridge across the Hellespont and march through Europe to Greece. If the Persians were defeated on land or sea, or if the Greeks destroyed the bridge, they would be in great danger. Artabanus also mentioned a past incident when the Scythians tried to convince the Ionians to destroy a bridge, which could have led to the downfall of Persia. He urged Xerxes not to take unnecessary risks and to think carefully about his decision. He believed that well-planned actions were more profitable, even if they were later thwarted by chance. Artabanus also warned Xerxes about the jealousy of the gods, who often struck down those who displayed too much pride. He advised patience and caution, as rushing into action could lead to failure and great losses. He then addressed Mardonius, telling him to stop speaking ill of the Greeks and not to provoke Xerxes into launching an expedition. He proposed a challenge: if an army must be sent against the Greeks, let Mardonius lead it while Xerxes stayed in Persia. They could stake their children's lives on the outcome. If Mardonius succeeded, Artabanus and his sons would be killed; if Mardonius failed, he and his sons would suffer the same fate. Artabanus predicted that if Mardonius insisted on leading the army to Greece, they would eventually hear of his defeat and death, torn apart by dogs and birds in Athens or Sparta, or even before reaching there. He urged Mardonius to consider the strength of the people he was persuading Xerxes to attack. 
11. Artabanus finished speaking, and Xerxes responded angrily, "Artabanus, you are my father's brother, and that's the only reason you won't be punished for your foolish words. But I will disgrace you by making you stay here with the women while I lead my army against Greece. I will accomplish everything I've said without your help. I swear by my ancestors that I will take revenge on the Athenians. I know that if we don't act, they will attack us, as they've already shown by burning Sardis and invading Asia. We can't avoid this conflict; we must either conquer them or be conquered. Honor demands that we avenge ourselves for what they've done to us. I want to see what terrible fate awaits me when I march against these Greeks, who were once so completely defeated by Pelops the Phrygian, a slave of my ancestors, that their land and people still bear his name." 
12. The conversation ended, and as night fell, Xerxes began to reconsider his decision due to Artabanus' advice. He realized that maybe sending an army against Greece wasn't the right thing to do. With this new decision in mind, he went to sleep. The Persians say that during the night, Xerxes had a dream in which a tall and handsome man appeared to him, saying, "Are you really changing your mind, Persian, and not leading the expedition against Greece, even after announcing the gathering of your army? Changing your mind is not good for you, and no one will forgive you for it. Stick to the path you chose yesterday." 
13. The vision spoke and then seemed to disappear. When morning came, Xerxes didn't pay much attention to the dream. He gathered the Persians he had previously assembled and spoke to them: "Persians, please forgive me for being indecisive. I haven't yet reached the peak of my wisdom, and I'm constantly surrounded by people urging me to follow my initial plan. It's true that when I heard Artabanus' opinion, my youthful spirit flared up, and I responded inappropriately and disrespectfully to someone older than me. But now I see my mistake and will follow his advice. Be at ease, as I've changed my mind about marching against Greece." 
14. When the Persians heard Xerxes' words, they were happy and showed their respect to him. However, when night came, the same vision appeared to Xerxes in his sleep and said, "Son of Darius, have you really announced the cancellation of your army's march to the Persians and ignored my words as if you never heard them? Be sure of this: if you don't lead your army right away, just as you quickly became great and powerful, you will be brought down just as fast." 
15. Xerxes was greatly frightened by the vision and quickly got out of bed. He sent a messenger to call Artabanus. When Artabanus arrived, Xerxes said, "Artabanus, I was foolish and responded to your wise advice with thoughtless words. It didn't take long for me to regret my actions and realize that I should follow your advice. However, even though I want to, I can't do it. Ever since I changed my mind, this vision keeps appearing and won't let me follow your advice. Just now, it threatened me and left. If a god is sending this vision and wants the expedition against Greece to happen, the same dream will come to you and give you the same command it gave me. I think this is most likely to happen if you wear my clothes, sit on my throne, and then sleep in my bed." 
16. Xerxes spoke, but Artabanus hesitated to obey the first command, thinking it wasn't right for him to sit on the royal throne. Eventually, he was persuaded and did as he was told, saying: "O king, it's equally important for a man to be wise and to listen to good advice. You have achieved both, but the influence of bad people trips you up, just like how the sea, which is very useful to humans, is prevented from following its nature by strong winds. It wasn't your harsh words that bothered me, but rather that when two opinions were presented to the Persians - one promoting pride and the other encouraging humility and warning against the constant desire for more - you chose the one that was more dangerous for you and the Persians. Now that you've changed your mind and chosen the better opinion, you say that a dream sent by a god is haunting you, preventing you from canceling the expedition against the Greeks. However, this isn't the work of the gods, my son. Dreams that visit people are usually related to their daily thoughts, and we've been preoccupied with this expedition lately. But if there is something divine about this dream, then let it appear to me as it did to you and give me the same command. If it truly wants to appear, it shouldn't matter if I'm wearing your clothes or sleeping in your bed. The dream wouldn't be so foolish as to think I'm you just because of the clothes I'm wearing. We need to find out if it will ignore me and not bother to appear, whether I'm wearing your robes or my own, but will keep coming to you. If it does, then I would agree that it's something divine. If you insist that I must sleep in your bed, then I'll do it, and let the dream appear to me as well. But until then, I'll stick to my current opinion." 
17. Artabanus spoke and did as he was told, hoping to prove Xerxes' words wrong. He put on Xerxes' clothes and sat on the king's throne. While he slept, the same dream that had haunted Xerxes came to him. The dream stood over him and said, "Are you the one who tries to convince Xerxes not to march against Greece because you care for him? You won't go unpunished for trying to change what must happen, neither now nor in the future. Xerxes has already been told what will happen to him if he disobeys." 
18. Artabanus felt threatened by the dream, as if it was about to burn his eyes with hot irons. He jumped up with a loud cry and sat next to Xerxes, telling him everything he had seen in the dream. Then he said, "O King, I've seen how the greater has often been defeated by the lesser, so I advised you not to let your youthful spirit take control, knowing that having too many desires can be harmful. I remembered the failed expeditions of Cyrus against the Massagetae, Cambyses against the Ethiopians, and my own journey with Darius against the Scythians. I believed that if you stayed in peace, everyone would consider you fortunate. But since there seems to be divine intervention, and the gods have marked Greece for destruction, I change my opinion and correct my judgment. Now, share the gods' message with the Persians and tell them to follow your first command to prepare for the expedition. Do this so that nothing on your part is missing in fulfilling the gods' mission." After this conversation, they were both motivated by the vision, and when daylight came, Xerxes shared everything with the Persians. Artabanus, who had previously openly opposed the plan, now openly supported it. 
19. Xerxes became determined to go on the expedition and then experienced a third dream. The Magi interpreted this dream to mean that the whole world would be under his control, and everyone would become his slaves. In the dream, Xerxes saw himself wearing a crown made of olive branches that spread across the entire earth, but then the crown disappeared from his head. The Magi explained the dream in this way, and immediately, all the Persians who had gathered went back to their provinces, eager to fulfill the king's command and receive the promised rewards. This is how Xerxes assembled his army, searching every corner of the continent. 
20. For four years after conquering Egypt, Xerxes spent his time gathering his forces and preparing everything needed for the expedition. By the end of the fifth year, he began his march with a massive army. This was the largest expedition known to us, far greater than any other. Darius' campaign against the Scythians pales in comparison, as does the Scythian invasion of Media, where they pursued the Cimmerians and conquered most of the upper lands of Asia. This led Darius to seek revenge against them later. The famous expedition led by the sons of Atreus against Troy also seems small in comparison, as does the campaign of the Mysians and Teucrians who, before the Trojan War, crossed the Bosporus into Europe, conquered the Thracians, and marched southward as far as the Ionian Sea and the river Peneus. 
21. This single expedition led by Xerxes was far greater than all other expeditions combined. Xerxes brought together people from every nation in Asia to fight against Greece. Almost every water source was drained by the massive army, except for the largest rivers. Different groups contributed in various ways: some provided ships, others joined the infantry, some supplied cavalry, while others offered transport for horses to follow the army. Additionally, some groups were responsible for building bridges, and others for supplying food and ships. 
22. Since earlier attempts to sail around Athos had resulted in shipwrecks, preparations had been underway for about three years. Triremes were anchored near Elaeus in the Chersonese, and from there, various people from the army were forced to take turns digging a canal, driven by whippings. The locals around Athos also helped with the digging. Two Persians, Bubares, son of Megabazus, and Artachaees, son of Artaeus, supervised the workers. Athos is a large and famous mountain that extends into the sea and is inhabited by people. At its landward end, it forms a peninsula with an isthmus about twelve stadia wide. This area has flat or slightly hilly terrain, stretching from the sea near Acanthus to the sea opposite Torone. On this isthmus, at the end of Athos, there is a Greek town called Sane. There are other towns located seaward of Sane and landward of Athos, which the Persians planned to turn into island towns rather than mainland ones. These towns include Dion, Olophyxus, Acrothoum, Thyssus, and Cleonae. 
23. The towns on Athos were divided among different nations for the digging project. They started digging a straight line near the town of Sane, and as the channel got deeper, some men stood at the bottom and dug, while others passed the dirt up to those standing on higher levels. The highest level workers then carried the dirt out and discarded it. All the workers, except for the Phoenicians, faced difficulties as the steep sides of the canal caved in, doubling their labor. This happened because they made the canal the same width at the top and bottom. However, the Phoenicians demonstrated their skill by making the top of the canal twice as wide as the bottom, gradually narrowing it as they dug deeper. This way, their work at the bottom matched the width of the other workers' sections. There was a meadow nearby where they set up a marketplace. Large amounts of ground grain were frequently brought in from Asia for the workers. 
24. From what I can gather, Xerxes ordered the canal to be dug out of pride, wanting to show off his power and leave a lasting memory. Even though it would have been easier to carry their ships across the isthmus, he commanded them to dig a canal wide enough for two triremes to sail side by side, connecting the seas. The same workers who were responsible for digging the canal were also tasked with building a bridge over the Strymon River. 
25. Xerxes took several actions to prepare for the journey. He instructed the Phoenicians and Egyptians to create ropes made of papyrus and white flax for the bridges and to gather provisions for his army. This ensured that neither the soldiers nor the animals carrying supplies would go hungry during their march to Hellas. After researching the best locations, he ordered them to store the provisions in suitable places, transporting them from various parts of Asia using cargo ships and transports. Most of the provisions were brought to the White Headland in Thrace, while some were sent to Tyrodiza in the Perinthian region, Doriscus, Eion on the Strymon River, or Macedonia. 
26. While the workers focused on their tasks, the land force had gathered and was marching with Xerxes to Sardis. They started from Critalla in Cappadocia, which was the designated meeting point for the entire army that would accompany Xerxes on the land journey. It is unclear which of his governors received the king's promised gifts for bringing the best-equipped army, or if this was ever decided. As they crossed the Halys River and entered Phrygia, they marched through the region to Celaenae. This is where the sources of the Maeander River and another equally large river, called Cataractes, can be found. The Cataractes River emerges right in the marketplace of Celaenae and flows into the Maeander. The skin of Marsyas the Silenus is also displayed there. According to Phrygian legend, it was flayed off by Apollo and hung up as a trophy. 
27. In the city, Pythius, the son of Atys, a Lydian, was waiting for them. He warmly welcomed Xerxes and his entire army, offering them great hospitality and expressing his willingness to provide funds for the war. Upon hearing this, Xerxes asked the Persians present who Pythius was and how wealthy he must be to make such an offer. They replied, "O king, this is the man who gifted your father Darius a golden plane-tree and vine. He is now the wealthiest person we know of, after you." 
28. Xerxes was amazed by this statement and asked Pythius directly about the extent of his wealth. Pythius replied, "O king, I won't hide the amount of my wealth from you, nor will I pretend not to know. I am well aware and will tell you the exact truth. When I learned that you were coming to the Greek sea, I wanted to contribute money for the war. So, I looked into my finances and found that I have two thousand talents of silver and four million gold Daric staters, short of just seven thousand. I freely offer all of this to you. As for me, I have enough to live on from my slaves and my farms." 
29. Upon hearing this, Xerxes was pleased and responded, "My Lydian friend, since leaving Persia, I have not encountered anyone who has willingly offered hospitality to my army or approached me uninvited to provide funds for the war, except for you. You have generously hosted my army and offered significant financial support. In return, I grant you my friendship and will give you the seven thousand staters from my own wealth to complete your total of four million, ensuring that you reach the desired even number. Continue to enjoy your current possessions and always remain the person you are now. You will not regret your actions, neither now nor in the future." 
30. Xerxes kept his promise and continued his journey. He passed by a Phrygian town called Anaua and a lake where salt was obtained. Then, he arrived at Colossae, a large city in Phrygia. There, the Lycus River flows into a gap in the ground and disappears, only to reappear about five stadia away, eventually joining the Maeander River. From Colossae, the army moved towards the border of Phrygia and Lydia, reaching the city of Cydrara. In this city, a pillar erected by Croesus stands, marking the boundary with an inscription. 
31. Leaving Phrygia and entering Lydia, Xerxes arrived at a fork in the road. The left path led to Caria, while the right one led to Sardis. To take the right path, travelers had to cross the Maeander River and pass by the city of Callatebus, where artisans produced honey from wheat and tamarisks. Xerxes chose this route and came across a beautiful plane-tree, which he decorated with gold. He also assigned one of his immortals to protect it. The following day, he reached the city of the Lydians. 
32. Upon arriving in Sardis, Xerxes first sent messengers to Greece to request earth and water, as well as to order the preparation of meals for the king. He sent these requests to every place except Athens and Sparta. The reason for asking for earth and water a second time was that Xerxes believed those who had not previously given it to Darius' messengers would now be forced to do so out of fear. Thus, he sent the messengers to confirm this assumption. 
33. After making his plans, Xerxes prepared to march to Abydos while his men built a bridge across the Hellespont, connecting Asia and Europe. On the Chersonese, near the Hellespont and between the cities of Sestus and Madytus, there is a wide headland facing Abydos. It was at this location that the Athenians, led by General Xanthippus, son of Ariphron, later captured Artayctes, a Persian governor of Sestus. They crucified him alive for his disrespectful acts, which included bringing women into the temple of Protesilaus at Elaeus and committing sacrilegious deeds there. 
34. The men assigned to this task began building bridges from Abydos to the headland. The Phoenicians used flaxen cables, while the Egyptians used papyrus. The distance from Abydos to the opposite shore is seven stadia. However, as soon as the bridges were built, a powerful storm struck, breaking and scattering everything. 
35. When Xerxes heard about the destruction of the bridges, he became furious. He ordered the Hellespont to be whipped with three hundred lashes and had a pair of shackles thrown into the sea. Some even say he sent people to brand the Hellespont. While whipping the waters, they were instructed to say harsh and arrogant words: "Bitter water, our master punishes you for causing him harm when he did nothing to you. King Xerxes will cross over you, whether you like it or not. No one offers you sacrifices justly, as you are a murky and salty river." Xerxes ordered these punishments for the sea and also commanded that the supervisors of the Hellespont bridge be executed. 
36. The people assigned to this difficult task started building new bridges. To reduce the strain on the cables, they placed fifty-oared ships and triremes next to each other, with 360 ships supporting the bridge closest to the Euxine Sea and 314 ships supporting the other bridge. The ships were positioned diagonally to the direction of the Pontus and parallel to the Hellespont's current. They secured the ships with large anchors on both ends to withstand winds from the Euxine Sea and the west and south winds from the Aegean Sea. They left a narrow passage for smaller boats to sail through between the fifty-oared ships and triremes. After that, they stretched the cables from the land and tightened them using wooden windlasses. They used two flaxen cables and four papyrus cables for each bridge. All cables looked the same and had the same thickness, but the flaxen ones were heavier. Once the bridges were built, they cut wooden logs to match the width of the floating supports and placed them on the tightened cables. They secured the logs together and then brought brushwood onto the bridge. They covered the brushwood with earth and packed it down. Finally, they built fences on both sides of the bridge to prevent animals and horses from being scared by the sight of the sea below. 
37. When the bridges, the work at Athos, and the canal were all completed, the army spent the winter there. As spring arrived, the army prepared to leave Sardis and march towards Abydos. As they set out, the sun suddenly disappeared from the sky, even though it was a clear day without clouds, turning day into night. Xerxes, worried by this event, asked the Magi what the vision could mean. They told him that the god was showing the Greeks that their cities would be abandoned. They explained that the sun was a prophet for the Greeks, while the moon was for the Persians. Xerxes was very happy to hear this and continued his march. 
38. As Xerxes led his army, Pythius the Lydian, both scared by the heavenly vision and encouraged by the gifts he had received, approached Xerxes and said, "Master, I have a favor to ask. It's easy for you to grant and very valuable for me to receive." Xerxes thought Pythius would ask for anything but what he actually requested, so he agreed to grant the favor and asked Pythius to reveal his wish. Hearing this, Pythius bravely said, "Master, I have five sons, and all of them are required to march with you against Greece. Please, O king, have mercy on me in my old age and release my eldest son from service, so he can take care of me and my possessions. You can take the other four sons with you, and may you return with all your goals achieved." 
39. Xerxes became very angry and responded, "How dare you? I am going to fight Greece myself, taking my sons, brothers, relatives, and friends with me. You, my servant, should have followed me with your entire family, including your wife, and now you speak to me about your son? Remember, a person's spirit lives in their ears; when it hears good words, it fills the body with joy, but when it hears the opposite, it becomes angry. When you served me well and promised more, you won't brag about outdoing your king in benefits. But now that you've shown shamelessness, you'll receive less than you deserve. Your hospitality saves you and four of your sons, but you'll be punished by losing the one you most want to keep." With that response, Xerxes immediately ordered his men to find Pythius' eldest son and cut him in half. They were to place one half of his body on the right side of the road and the other on the left, so the army would pass between them. 
40. The army followed the orders and passed between the two halves of the body. First, the baggage train and the animals carrying loads went through, followed by a mixed group of soldiers from various nations, not in their divisions but all mixed together. When more than half had passed, there was a gap, and these soldiers did not come near the king. After that, a thousand chosen Persian horsemen went first, followed by a thousand elite spearmen with their spears pointing down. Next came ten splendidly equipped horses of the Nesaean breed, named after the wide plain in Media where these great horses were bred. Behind these ten horses was the sacred chariot of Zeus, drawn by eight white horses. The charioteer walked behind the horses, holding the reins, as no mortal man was allowed to sit in that seat. After this came Xerxes himself, riding in a chariot pulled by Nesaean horses. Beside him was his charioteer, named Patiramphes, the son of Otanes, a Persian. 
41. Xerxes rode out from Sardis in this manner, but whenever he felt like it, he would switch from the chariot to a carriage. Behind him, a thousand spearmen of the finest and noblest Persian blood followed, carrying their spears in the usual way. After them came a thousand selected Persian horsemen, followed by ten thousand foot soldiers, chosen from the rest of the Persians. One thousand of these soldiers had golden pomegranates on their spear-shafts instead of spikes and surrounded the others, while the nine thousand inside this circle had silver pomegranates. The soldiers with their spears pointing down also had golden pomegranates, and those closest to Xerxes had golden apples. After the ten thousand soldiers, ten thousand Persian horsemen followed in formation. Then, there was a gap of two stadia, after which the rest of the crowd followed, all mixed together. 
42. The army traveled from Lydia to the river Caicus and through the land of Mysia. They left the Caicus and went through Atarneus to the city of Carene, with the mountain of Cane on their left. From there, they journeyed across the plain of Thebe, passing the city of Adramytteum and the Pelasgian city of Antandrus. Then, they entered the territory of Ilium, with Mount Ida on their left. When they stopped for the night at the foot of Mount Ida, a thunderstorm with lightning struck, killing many of them there. 
43. When the army reached the river Scamander, it was the first river since they started their march from Sardis that didn't have enough water for both the soldiers and the animals to drink. Upon arriving at the river, Xerxes went up to the citadel of Priam, curious to see it. After looking around and asking questions about the place, he sacrificed a thousand cattle to Athena of Ilium, and the Magi poured offerings to the heroes. After this, a sudden panic spread through the camp during the night. When daylight came, they continued their journey, passing the cities of Rhoetium, Ophryneum, and Dardanus, which is near Abydos, on their left, and the Teucrian Gergithae on their right. 
44. When they arrived at Abydos, Xerxes wanted to see his entire army. A high seat made of white stone had been built for him on a hill by the people of Abydos, as per the king's orders. From there, he sat and watched the seashore, observing his army and fleet. He wanted to see the ships compete in a race, so they did. The Phoenicians of Sidon emerged as the winners, and Xerxes was happy with both the race and his expedition. 
45. When Xerxes saw the entire Hellespont filled with ships and the shores and plains of Abydos crowded with people, he first felt a sense of happiness and then began to cry. 
46. Xerxes' uncle, Artabanus, noticed his tears. Artabanus had earlier advised Xerxes not to march against Hellas and now asked him, "O king, why are you crying after just feeling so blessed?" Xerxes replied, "I felt sad when I thought about how short human life is, and how none of these people will be alive in a hundred years." Artabanus responded, "We have more significant sorrows in our lives than that. Even though our lives are short, everyone experiences times when they wish they were dead instead of alive. We face misfortunes and illnesses that make our short lives feel long and miserable. Life is so difficult that death often seems like a better option. It's as if the gods are envious, only giving us a small taste of the joy of living." 
47. Xerxes replied, "Artabanus, you're right about human life. Let's not dwell on that and focus on our current success instead. But tell me, if you hadn't seen that vision in your dream, would you still have advised me not to march against Hellas, or would you have changed your mind? Please, be honest with me." Artabanus responded, "O king, I hope the vision from my dream leads to the outcome we both want! But even now, I'm still full of fear and worry for many reasons, especially since the two most significant things in the world seem to be your greatest enemies." 
48. Xerxes replied, "What do you mean? What are these two things that you say are my greatest enemies? Are you suggesting that there's a problem with the size of my land army? Do you think the Greek army will be much larger than ours? Or do you believe our navy won't be as strong as theirs? Or is it both? If you think our forces are lacking in any way, we should gather more troops as soon as possible." 
49. Artabanus replied, "O king, there's no issue with the size of your army or the number of your ships. In fact, if you gather more, those two things I mentioned will become even bigger enemies. These two are the land and the sea. The sea doesn't have enough harbors to accommodate your navy, especially during a storm. You need multiple harbors along the coast, but they don't exist. Remember, we can't control everything that happens to us. Now, let me explain the other enemy: the land. As you keep advancing without any obstacles, the land becomes more dangerous because you don't know what lies ahead. People are never satisfied with their achievements. So, if no one stops you, the expansion of your territory and the time it takes to conquer it will eventually lead to famine. The best person is cautious when making plans, considering all possible outcomes, but acts boldly when it's time to execute those plans." 
50. Xerxes replied, "Artabanus, your points are reasonable. However, don't be afraid of everything and don't overthink every situation. If you constantly worry about every possible outcome, you'll never take any action. It's better to act boldly and face some of the challenges you fear, rather than being paralyzed by fear and never experiencing anything. If you always argue against every idea without offering a foolproof alternative, you're just as wrong as someone with the opposite opinion. No one can truly know what's safe or not, as we're only human. Those who take action often reap the rewards, not those who hesitate and overanalyze every possibility. Look at the power Persia has achieved. If the kings before me had thought like you, or if they had advisors like you, we wouldn't be as successful as we are now. They took risks and brought us to this level of greatness. Big achievements come from taking big risks. We'll follow their example; we're traveling during the best time of the year, and we'll return home victorious, having conquered all of Europe without facing famine or any other harm. Firstly, we're bringing plenty of provisions with us. Secondly, we'll have access to the resources of the lands we invade, as we're marching against farmers, not nomads." 
51. Artabanus then said, "O king, I see that you don't want us to be afraid of any danger. But please consider my advice, as it's important to discuss our plans thoroughly when the stakes are so high. Cyrus, the son of Cambyses, conquered and made all Ionians, except the Athenians, subjects of Persia. I suggest that you don't bring these Ionians to fight against their homeland, as we can defeat our enemies without their help. If they join our army, they'll either act unjustly by enslaving their own people or justly by helping them gain freedom. If they act unjustly, it won't benefit us much, but if they act justly, they could cause significant harm to our army. Remember the old saying: the outcome of every action isn't clear at the beginning." 
52. Xerxes replied, "Artabanus, your biggest mistake in your statements is worrying that the Ionians might switch sides. We have a strong guarantee of their loyalty, as you and everyone who marched with Darius against the Scythians can testify. They had the power to destroy or save the entire Persian army, and they proved their loyalty and honesty without any malicious intent. Besides, they've left their families and possessions in our country, so it's unlikely they'll suddenly change sides. Let go of that fear; stay strong and protect my family and rule. I entrust you with the symbols of my kingship." 
53. Xerxes spoke and sent Artabanus back to Susa. He then called for the most distinguished Persians, and when they gathered, he said, "Persians, I ask you to be brave and never tarnish the great and glorious past achievements of our people. Let's all work together, as the success we seek benefits us all. I urge you to put your full effort into this war. I know we're going up against courageous men, but if we defeat them, no other army in the world will ever stand against us. Now, let's cross over after praying to the gods who protect Persia." 
54. They spent the entire day preparing to cross. The next day, they waited until sunrise, burning various incense on the bridges and covering the road with myrtle branches. As the sun rose, Xerxes poured a liquid offering from a golden container into the sea, praying to the sun that nothing would stop him from conquering Europe up to its farthest borders. After the prayer, he threw the golden container, a golden bowl, and a Persian sword called "acinaces" into the Hellespont. It's unclear whether he threw these items as offerings to the sun or as a way to make up for whipping the sea earlier. 
55. After completing the rituals, they began to cross. The infantry and cavalry used the bridge closest to the Pontus, while the pack animals and support teams used the bridge towards the Aegean. Ten thousand Persians, all wearing garlands, led the way, followed by a mixed army of various nations. They crossed throughout the day. The next day, the horsemen and those carrying reversed spears crossed first, also wearing garlands. They were followed by the sacred horses, the sacred chariot, Xerxes himself, the spearmen, a thousand horsemen, and the rest of the army. At the same time, the ships sailed across to the other shore. However, some say that the king was the last to cross. 
56. When Xerxes arrived in Europe, he watched his army crossing as they were whipped. It took them seven days and seven nights to cross without stopping. It is said that after Xerxes crossed the Hellespont, a man from the region exclaimed, "O Zeus, why have you disguised yourself as a Persian man and changed your name to Xerxes, leading the entire world to uproot Greece? You could have done that without all this effort." 
57. When everyone had crossed over and was ready to move, a significant omen occurred among them. Xerxes ignored it, even though it was easy to understand: a mare gave birth to a hare. The meaning was clear: Xerxes would lead his army to Greece with great fanfare and arrogance, but would return to the same place fleeing for his life. Another omen appeared to him at Sardis: a mule gave birth to a mule with both male and female genitals, the male above the other. However, he disregarded both signs and continued his journey with the land army. 
58. Xerxes' navy sailed out of the Hellespont, traveling alongside the land army. The ships headed west towards the Sarpedon headland, where Xerxes had instructed them to wait for him. Meanwhile, the land army marched east through the Chersonese, passing the tomb of Athamas' daughter Helle on their right and the town of Cardia on their left. They marched through a city called Agora. From there, they rounded the head of the Black Bay and crossed the Black River, which couldn't withstand the army's force and eventually gave out. After crossing the river, they continued west, passing the Aeolian city of Aenus and the Stentor marsh, until they reached Doriscus. 
59. Doriscus is located in Thrace, a vast plain by the sea with the large Hebrus River flowing through it. A royal fortress called Doriscus had been built there, and a Persian guard had been stationed by Darius since his campaign against Scythia. Xerxes found it to be a suitable place to organize and count his army, so he did. By this time, all the ships had arrived at Doriscus. At Xerxes' command, the captains brought them to the beach near Doriscus, where the Samothracian city of Sane and Zone were located, as well as the well-known headland of Serreum. This land was once inhabited by the Cicones. The ships were brought to the beach and pulled ashore for rest. Meanwhile, Xerxes counted his forces at Doriscus. 
60. I cannot provide the exact number each group contributed to the total, as there is no record of it. However, the entire land army was found to consist of 1,700,000 soldiers. They were counted in the following manner: ten thousand men were gathered in one place and packed together as tightly as possible. A line was drawn around them, and after they were sent away, a stone wall was built along the line, reaching up to a man's waist. This process was repeated until all the soldiers were counted. Once they were numbered, they were organized by their respective nations. 
61. The soldiers in the army were equipped as follows: The Persians wore loose caps called tiaras on their heads, embroidered sleeved tunics with iron scales resembling fish scales on their bodies, and trousers on their legs. They carried wicker shields with quivers hanging beneath them, short spears, long bows, reed arrows, and daggers hanging from their belts by their right thighs. Their commander was Otanes, son of Amestris and father of Xerxes' wife. The Greeks used to call them Cephenes, but they called themselves Artaei, as did their neighbors. The name "Persians" came from Perses, the son of Perseus and Danae, who was the son of Zeus. Perseus married Andromeda, the daughter of Cepheus, son of Belus. Since Cepheus had no male children, Perseus left his son Perses with him, and the Persians took their name from this Perses. 
62. The Medes in the army had similar equipment to the Persians, as that style of armor actually originated from the Medes, not the Persians. Their commander was Tigranes, an Achaemenid. The Medes were once called Arians by everyone, but their name changed to Medes after the Colchian woman Medea came from Athens to the Arians, according to their own account. The Cissians in the army also had similar equipment to the Persians, but they wore turbans instead of caps. Their commander was Anaphes, son of Otanes. The Hyrcanians were armed like the Persians as well, and their leader was Megapanus, who later became the governor of Babylon. 
63. The Assyrians in the army wore unique helmets made of twisted bronze, which were difficult to describe. They carried shields, spears, and Egyptian-style daggers, as well as wooden clubs with iron studs. They also wore linen breastplates. The Greeks called them Syrians, but others referred to them as Assyrians. The Chaldeans were also part of this group. Their commander was Otaspes, son of Artachaees. 
64. The Bactrians in the army wore headgear similar to the Medians, and they carried their native reed bows and short spears. The Sacae, who were actually Scythians, wore tall, stiff caps that tapered to a point. They also wore trousers and carried their native bows, daggers, and axes called "sagaris." Although they were Amyrgian Scythians, they were called Sacae, which is the Persian name for all Scythians. Hystaspes, son of Darius and Cyrus' daughter Atossa, was the commander of both the Bactrians and Sacae. 
65. The Indians wore clothes made from tree fibers and carried reed bows with iron-tipped reed arrows. That was their gear, and they were assigned to march under the command of Pharnazathres, son of Artabates. 
66. The Arians had Median bows and were equipped similarly to the Bactrians. Their commander was Sisamnes, son of Hydarnes. The Parthians, Chorasmians, Sogdians, Gandarians, and Dadicae in the army also had the same equipment as the Bactrians. Artabazus, son of Pharnaces, commanded the Parthians and Chorasmians; Azanes, son of Artaeus, led the Sogdians; and Artyphius, son of Artabanus, was in charge of the Gandarians and Dadicae. 
67. The Caspians in the army wore cloaks, carried their native reed bows, and had short swords. Their equipment was simple, and their leader was Ariomardus, brother of Artyphius. The Sarangae stood out in their colorful clothes and knee-high boots, carrying bows and Median spears. Pherendates, son of Megabazus, was their commander. The Pactyes wore cloaks and carried their native bows and daggers. Artayntes, son of Ithamitres, was their commander. 
68. The Utians, Mycians, and Paricanians had the same equipment as the Pactyes. Arsamenes, son of Darius, was the commander of the Utians and Mycians, while Siromitres, son of Oeobazus, led the Paricanians. 
69. The Arabians wore tied-up mantles and carried long, curved bows on their right side. The Ethiopians wore leopard and lion skins and carried long bows made of palmwood strips, as well as short arrows with sharpened stone tips instead of iron. They also had spears with sharpened gazelle horn tips and studded clubs. Before going into battle, they painted half their bodies with gypsum and the other half with red paint. The Arabians and Ethiopians living above Egypt were led by Arsames, son of Darius and Artystone, daughter of Cyrus. Darius loved Artystone the most among his wives and even had a gold statue made of her. 
70. The Ethiopians above Egypt and the Arabians were led by Arsames, while the eastern Ethiopians, who were part of the army, joined the Indians. These eastern Ethiopians looked similar to the others, but had straight hair and spoke differently. The Libyan Ethiopians had the woolliest hair of all people. The eastern Ethiopians mostly had the same weapons as the Indians, but they wore horse forehead skins on their heads, with the mane as a crest and the ears standing upright. They used shields made from crane skin. 
71. The Libyans wore leather clothes and used burnt wood javelins. Their leader was Massages, son of Oarizus. 
72. In the army, the Paphlagonians wore woven helmets, carried small shields, short spears, javelins, and daggers. They also wore their traditional shoes that reached up to their knees. The Ligyes, Matieni, Mariandyni, and Syrians had similar equipment as the Paphlagonians. The Persians called these Syrians "Cappadocians." Dotus, son of Megasidrus, led the Paphlagonians and Matieni, while Gobryas, son of Darius and Artystone, commanded the Mariandyni, Ligyes, and Syrians. 
73. The Phrygians had equipment very similar to the Paphlagonians, with only minor differences. According to the Macedonians, these Phrygians were called Briges when they lived in Europe, where they were neighbors of the Macedonians. However, when they moved to Asia, they changed their name to Phrygians. The Armenians, who originally came from Phrygia, had the same weapons as the Phrygians. Both groups were led by Artochmes, who was married to a daughter of Darius. 
74. The Lydians had armor very similar to the Greeks. They were once called Meiones, but changed their name after Lydus, son of Atys. The Mysians wore their traditional helmets, carried small shields, and used burnt wood javelins. They originally came from Lydia and were named Olympieni after Mount Olympus. Artaphrenes, son of Artaphrenes, led both the Lydians and Mysians. He was the same person who attacked Marathon with Datis. 
75. In the army, the Thracians wore fox-skin caps on their heads and tunics on their bodies. They also wore embroidered mantles over their tunics, fawnskin shoes on their feet and legs, and carried javelins, small shields, and daggers. They were called Bithynians after they moved to Asia, but before that, they were known as Strymonians because they lived near the Strymon River. They claim that they were forced to leave their homes by the Teucrians and Mysians. The leader of the Asian Thracians was Bassaces, son of Artabanus. 
76. The Pisidians had small shields made of raw oxhide and carried two spears used for hunting wolves. They wore bronze helmets, which had bronze ox ears and horns, as well as crests. Their legs were wrapped with strips of purple cloth. Among these people, there was a sacred place for predicting the future, dedicated to the god of war, Ares. 
77. The Cabelees, who are also known as Meiones and Lasonii, had the same equipment as the Cilicians. I will describe their equipment when I talk about the Cilicians later in the story. The Milyae had short spears and garments fastened with brooches. Some of them carried Lycian bows and wore skin caps on their heads. Badres, son of Hystanes, was the leader of all these people. 
78. The Moschi wore wooden helmets, carried shields, and had small spears with long tips. The Tibareni, Macrones, and Mossynoeci in the army had similar equipment to the Moschi. The leaders of these groups were Ariomardus, son of Darius and Parmys, daughter of Cyrus' son Smerdis, who led the Moschi and Tibareni. Artayctes, son of Cherasmis, who was the governor of Sestus on the Hellespont, led the Macrones and Mossynoeci. 
79. The Mares wore woven helmets native to their region, carried javelins, and had small hide shields. The Colchians had wooden helmets, small shields made of raw oxhide, short spears, and swords. Pharandates, son of Teaspis, was the leader of the Mares and Colchians. The Alarodians and Saspires in the army had similar equipment to the Colchians, and their leader was Masistius, son of Siromitres. 
80. The island tribes from the Red Sea and the islands where the king placed the people known as Exiles had clothing and armor similar to the Median people. Mardontes, son of Bagaeus, led these islanders. In the following year, he was a general at Mykale and died in battle. 
81. These are the nations that formed the infantry on the mainland. The commanders I mentioned earlier organized and counted them, and appointed leaders for groups of thousands and ten thousands. The leaders of ten thousands then appointed leaders for groups of hundreds and tens. There were also other leaders in charge of smaller units and specific nations. 
82. As I mentioned earlier, these were the commanders. The generals in charge of these units and the entire infantry were Mardonius, son of Gobryas; Tritantaechmes, son of Artabanus who advised against the expedition to Hellas; Smerdomenes, son of Otanes (both Tritantaechmes and Smerdomenes were sons of Darius' brothers, making them Xerxes' cousins); Masistes, son of Darius and Atossa; Gergis, son of Ariazus; and Megabyzus, son of Zopyrus. 
83. The generals I mentioned earlier were in charge of the entire infantry, except for the Ten Thousand. Hydarnes, son of Hydarnes, led these elite ten thousand Persians, known as Immortals. They were called this because when one of them died or fell ill, another was chosen to maintain their number at ten thousand. The Persians were the most richly adorned and the best soldiers in the army. Their equipment was as I described earlier, and they stood out due to the large amount of gold they possessed. They also brought carriages with concubines and many well-equipped servants. Camels and other animals carried their food separately from the rest of the army. 
84. Some of these nations had horsemen, but not all of them provided cavalry. Only the Persians did so, and their equipment was similar to their infantry. The only difference was that some of them wore helmets made of hammered bronze and iron. 
85. There were also nomadic people called Sagartians who spoke Persian and had equipment that was a mix of Persian and Pactyan styles. They provided eight thousand horsemen. They didn't wear bronze or iron armor, but carried daggers and used ropes made of twisted leather. They relied on these ropes in battle. When they fought, they would throw the ropes with a noose at the end towards their enemies. They would then pull back whatever they caught, whether it was a horse or a person, and the enemy would get tangled in the rope and be killed. This was their fighting style, and they were grouped with the Persians. 
86. The Median cavalry had the same equipment as their infantry, and the Cissians were similar. The Indians were armed like their infantry, riding fast horses and driving chariots pulled by horses and wild asses. The Bactrians had the same equipment as their foot soldiers, as did the Caspians. The Libyans were also armed like their infantry and drove chariots. The Caspians and Paricanians had the same equipment as their infantry as well. The Arabians had the same equipment as their infantry, and they all rode on camels that were as fast as horses. 
87. Only these nations had horsemen, totaling eighty thousand, not including camels and chariots. All the other horsemen were placed with their groups, while the Arabians were positioned at the back. This was because horses are scared of camels, so they were kept at the rear to avoid frightening the horses. 
88. The cavalry leaders were Harmamithres and Tithaeus, sons of Datis. The third leader, Pharnuches, was left behind at Sardis due to illness. As they left Sardis, an unfortunate accident happened to him: a dog ran under his horse's feet, startling the horse, which then reared up and threw Pharnuches off. After falling, he vomited blood and started to deteriorate. Following Pharnuches' orders, his servants took the horse to the spot where it had thrown him and cut off its legs at the knee. This is how Pharnuches lost his command. 
89. There were 1,207 triremes, provided by the following groups: the Phoenicians and the Syrians of Palestine supplied 300 ships. Their equipment included helmets similar to the Greek style, linen breastplates, rimless shields, and javelins. According to the Phoenicians, they originally lived by the Red Sea before moving to the Syrian coast. This area, stretching to Egypt, is called Palestine. The Egyptians provided 200 ships. They wore woven helmets, carried large-rimmed hollow shields, sea-warfare spears, and big battle-axes. Many of them also wore cuirasses and carried long swords. 
90. Their armor was as described. The Cyprians provided 150 ships. Their leaders wore head-wraps called turbans, and the people wore tunics, but in other aspects, they were similar to the Greeks. The Cyprians were made up of various tribes, including those from Salamis, Athens, Arcadia, Cythnus, Phoenice, and Ethiopia, according to their own accounts. 
91. The Cilicians provided 100 ships. They wore their native helmets, carried raw oxhide shields, and wore woolen tunics. Each had two javelins and a sword similar to Egyptian knives. The Cilicians were once called Hypachaei and were named after Cilix, son of Agenor, a Phoenician. The Pamphylians supplied 100 ships and were armed like the Greeks. They were descendants of the dispersed Trojans who followed Amphilochus and Calchas. 
92. The Lycians provided 50 ships. They wore cuirasses and greaves, carried cornel-wood bows, unfeathered arrows, and javelins. They had goat-skins hanging from their shoulders and wore feather-crowned caps on their heads. They also had daggers and scimitars. The Lycians originally came from Crete and were once called Termilae. They were named after Lycus, son of Pandion, an Athenian. 
93. The Asian Dorians provided 30 ships and had Greek armor. They were originally from the Peloponnese region. The Carians supplied 70 ships and had scimitars and daggers, but the rest of their equipment was Greek. I mentioned their former name earlier in my history. 
94. The Ionians provided 100 ships and had equipment similar to the Greeks. When they lived in the Peloponnese, they resided in an area now called Achaia. Before Danaus and Xuthus arrived in the Peloponnese, according to the Greeks, they were known as Aegialian Pelasgians. They were later named Ionians after Ion, the son of Xuthus. 
95. The islanders provided 17 ships and were armed like the Greeks. They also came from Pelasgian origins, which later became known as Ionian for the same reason as the Ionians from the twelve cities who came from Athens. The Aeolians supplied 60 ships and had Greek equipment. They were once called Pelasgian, according to Greek stories. The people of the Hellespont, specifically those from Abydos, were ordered by the king to stay home and guard the bridges. The rest of the people from Pontus who joined the army provided 100 ships and were equipped like the Greeks. They were settlers from the Ionians and Dorians. 
96. Persians, Medes, and Sacae served as soldiers on all the ships. The best ships were provided by the Phoenicians, especially the Sidonians. Just like the infantry, each group had their local leaders, but their names are not mentioned here because they are not important for this story. Each city within each nation had its own leader, but they were not generals, rather they were like slaves, similar to the rest of the expedition. The top generals and Persian commanders of each nation have already been mentioned earlier. 
97. The navy's admirals were Ariabignes, son of Darius; Prexaspes, son of Aspathines; Megabazus, son of Megabates; and Achaemenes, son of Darius. Ariabignes, son of Darius and Gobryas' daughter, led the Ionian and Carian fleet. Achaemenes, Xerxes' full brother, was in charge of the Egyptian fleet, while the other two admirals led the remaining forces. In total, there were 3,000 ships, including those with thirty and fifty oars, light galleys, and large horse transports. 
98. Among the most famous people on board the ships were: Tetramnestus, son of Anysus from Sidon; Matten, son of Siromus from Tyre; Merbalus, son of Agbalus from Aradus; Syennesis, son of Oromedon from Cilicia; Cyberniscus, son of Sicas from Lycia; Gorgus, son of Chersis and Timonax, son of Timagoras from Cyprus; and from Caria, Histiaeus, son of Tymnes, Pigres, son of Hysseldomus, and Damasithymus, son of Candaules. 
99. There's no need to mention other captains, except for Artemisia. It's quite amazing that a woman joined the expedition against Hellas. After her husband's death, she took over his rule, even though she had a young son, and joined the army out of courage and determination, not because she was forced to. Artemisia was the daughter of Lygdamis, with Halicarnassian heritage from her father's side and Cretan from her mother's side. She led the people of Halicarnassus, Cos, Nisyrus, and Calydnos, and provided five ships. Her ships were considered the best in the fleet after the Sidonian ships, and she gave the king the best advice among all his allies. The cities she led were all of Dorian origin, as the Halicarnassians came from Troezen and the others from Epidaurus. 
100. This concludes the description of the fleet. Once his army was organized and counted, Xerxes wanted to ride through and inspect it. He rode in a chariot, passing by each nation's soldiers, asking them questions while his scribes recorded everything. He did this for both the cavalry and infantry. After that, the ships were launched into the sea. Xerxes then boarded a Sidonian ship and sat under a golden canopy as he was taken past the ships' prows, questioning the men just like he did with the army, and having their answers written down. The captains positioned their ships 400 feet from the shore, facing the land, with the marines ready for battle. Xerxes observed them by passing between the prows and the land. 
101. After passing by his entire fleet and leaving the ship, Xerxes called for Demaratus, son of Ariston, who had joined him on the expedition against Hellas. He asked Demaratus, "As a Greek from a prominent city, I want to know: will the Greeks fight against me? I believe that even if all the Greeks and people from the western lands joined forces, they couldn't withstand my attack unless they were united. But I want to hear your opinion." Demaratus replied, "O king, do you want me to speak the truth or try to please you?" Xerxes urged him to speak the truth, assuring him that it wouldn't upset him any more than before. 
102. Upon hearing this, Demaratus said, "O King, since you want me to speak the whole truth and not say anything that will later be proven false, let me tell you that in Hellas, poverty is always present, but courage is gained through wisdom and strong laws. With this courage, Hellas protects itself from poverty and tyranny. I respect all the Greeks living in the Dorian lands, but I will only speak about the Lacedaemonians. First, they will never accept any terms from you that would enslave Hellas; and second, they will fight against you even if all the other Greeks join your side. Don't ask me how many of these men can do this; they will fight with you whether they have an army of a thousand men, more than that, or even less." 
103. Upon hearing this, Xerxes smiled and said, "Demaratus, it's quite strange to claim that a thousand men would fight against such a massive army! Tell me, since you were once their king, would you be willing to fight ten men right now? If your people are as you describe, then as their king, you should be able to face twice as many according to your laws. If each of them can fight ten men from my army, then it's clear that you must be able to fight twenty to prove your point. But if you Greeks, who boast so much, are just like you and the others who speak with me, and are of the same size, be careful that your words aren't just empty bragging. Let's think about it reasonably: how could a thousand, ten thousand, or even fifty thousand men, if they are all equally free and not under one ruler, stand against my huge army? Even if there were five thousand Greeks, we would still outnumber them by more than a thousand to one. If they were under one ruler like us, they might become better than they naturally are out of fear and, driven by the whip, might fight against larger numbers of weaker men; but if they are free, they wouldn't do either. I believe that even if they had equal numbers, it would be difficult for the Greeks to fight just against the Persians. What you're talking about is only found among us, and even then, it's rare; some of my Persian soldiers would gladly fight three Greeks at once. You don't know this and are just talking nonsense." 
104. Demaratus replied, "O king, I knew from the start that the truth would be unwelcome to you. But since you asked me to speak honestly, I've told you the truth about the Spartans. You know how much I love them: they took away my position and privileges, and made me an exile without a city. Your father welcomed me, gave me a home, and provided for me. A sensible person wouldn't reject such kindness but would cherish it. I don't claim that I can fight ten men or even two, and I wouldn't even want to fight one. However, if it were necessary or if a great challenge motivated me, I'd gladly fight one of those men who say they can each defeat three Greeks. The Lacedaemonians are like this: individually, they are as brave as anyone, and together, they are the best warriors in the world. They are free, but not completely, as they are ruled by law, which they fear more than your men fear you. They obey the law, which always commands them never to flee from battle, no matter how many enemies they face, but to stay at their post and either win or die. If you think my words are foolish, then I'll remain silent from now on. I only spoke because you asked me to. But may your wish come true, King." 
105. Demaratus gave his response. Xerxes didn't take it seriously and showed no anger, but dismissed him kindly. After talking with Demaratus, Xerxes replaced the governor Darius had appointed in Doriscus with Mascames, the son of Megadostes. Then, Xerxes led his army through Thrace towards Greece. 
106. Xerxes left Mascames behind, who proved to be so capable that Xerxes sent him gifts every year, considering him the most valiant of all the governors appointed by him or Darius. Artaxerxes, Xerxes' son, also sent gifts to Mascames' descendants. Before this journey, governors had been appointed throughout Thrace and the Hellespont. After the expedition, all of these governors in Thrace and the Hellespont, except for the one in Doriscus, were captured by the Greeks. However, no one could ever remove Mascames from Doriscus, despite many attempts. For this reason, gifts continued to be sent by the successive kings of Persia. 
107. Xerxes considered Boges, the only one among those driven out by the Greeks, a brave man. The Greeks had captured Eion from him. Xerxes never stopped praising Boges and greatly honored his surviving sons in Persia. Indeed, Boges proved himself worthy of all praise. When the Athenians, led by Cimon, the son of Miltiades, besieged him, he could have left Eion under a treaty and returned to Asia. However, he refused, fearing that the king might think he had saved his life out of cowardice. Instead, he resisted until the end. When there was no food left within the city, he built a large pyre and killed his children, wife, concubines, and servants, throwing them into the fire. After that, he took all the gold and silver from the city and scattered it from the walls into the Strymon River. Having done this, he threw himself into the fire. To this day, the Persians rightfully praise him. 
108. From Doriscus, Xerxes continued his journey towards Hellas, forcing everyone he encountered to join his army. As mentioned earlier, all the land up to Thessaly had been conquered and was under the king's control, thanks to the efforts of Megabazus and Mardonius. On his way from Doriscus, Xerxes first passed the Samothracian fortresses. The westernmost city among these is called Mesambria, and next to it is the Thasian city of Stryme. The river Lisus flows between them, but it couldn't provide enough water for Xerxes' army and eventually ran dry. This entire region was once known as Gallaic, but now it is called Briantic. However, it rightfully belongs to the Ciconians. 
109. After crossing the dried-up bed of the Lisus River, Xerxes went by the Greek cities of Maronea, Dicaea, and Abdera. He passed these cities and some famous lakes nearby: the Ismarid Lake, which lies between Maronea and Stryme, and the Bistonian Lake near Dicaea, where the Travus and Compsantus rivers flow into. Near Abdera, Xerxes didn't pass any famous lakes, but he crossed the Nestus River where it flows into the sea. From these regions, he went by the cities on the mainland, one of which has a lake nearby that is about thirty stadia in size, full of fish and very salty. This lake was drained dry just by providing water for the pack animals. This city is called Pistyrus. 
110. Xerxes marched past the Greek coastal cities, keeping them on his left. He traveled through the lands of various Thracian tribes, including the Paeti, Cicones, Bistones, Sapaei, Dersaei, Edoni, and Satrae. Among these tribes, those who lived by the sea joined his army on ships, while those living inland, whose names I have mentioned, were forced to join his land army. The only exception was the Satrae tribe. 
111. The Satrae tribe, as far as we know, has never been under anyone's control. They are the only Thracians who have always lived freely. They reside in high mountains filled with various forests and snow, and they are skilled warriors. They have a sacred place for divination dedicated to Dionysus, located in their highest mountains. The Bessi, a clan of the Satrae, serve as the shrine's prophets. There is a priestess who gives the oracle, just like at Delphi, and the process is no more complex here than it is there. 
112. After traveling through the previously mentioned land, Xerxes then passed the fortresses of the Pierians, one named Phagres and the other Pergamus. By taking this route, he marched right under their walls, keeping the large and tall Pangaean mountain range on his right. In this range, the Pierians, Odomanti, and especially the Satrae have gold and silver mines. 
113. Marching past the Paeonians, Doberes, and Paeoplae, who live beyond and to the north of the Pangaean mountains, Xerxes continued heading west until he reached the Strymon River and the city of Eion. The city's governor, Boges, whom I mentioned earlier, was still alive at that time. The region surrounding the Pangaean range is called Phyllis, which extends west to the Angites River, flowing into the Strymon, and south to the Strymon River itself. At this river, the Magi tried to find good omens by sacrificing white horses. 
114. After performing these rituals and many others on the river, they crossed it at a place called Nine Ways in Edonian territory, using the bridges they found there. When they discovered the name of the place was Nine Ways, they buried nine boys and girls, who were children of the local people, alive. Burying people alive is a Persian tradition. I found out that when Xerxes' wife Amestris became old, she buried fourteen sons of prominent Persians as an offering for herself to the mythical god of the underworld. 
115. Traveling from the Strymon River, the army passed by Argilus, a Greek town located further west along the coast. The area of this town and the land further inland are called Bisaltia. From there, keeping the gulf off Poseideion on his left, Xerxes crossed the plain of Syleus (as it is called), passed by the Greek town of Stagirus, and arrived at Acanthus. He included all these tribes and those living around the Pangaean range in his forces, just as he did with the previously mentioned tribes. The coastal people served in his fleet, while the inland people joined his land army. The Thracians still hold the entire road that King Xerxes led his army along in high regard and neither break it up nor sow it to this day. 
116. When Xerxes arrived at Acanthus, he considered the Acanthians as his guests and friends. He gave them Median clothing and praised them for their enthusiasm in supporting his campaign, as well as for their efforts in digging the canal. 
117. While Xerxes was in Acanthus, Artachaees, the supervisor of the canal digging, passed away due to an illness. He was highly favored by Xerxes, belonged to the Achaemenid lineage, and was the tallest man in Persia, just four finger-breadths short of five royal cubits in height. He also had the loudest voice on earth. Xerxes deeply mourned his loss and arranged a grand funeral and burial for him, with the entire army offering libations on his tomb. Following the instructions of an oracle, the Acanthians consider Artachaees a hero and perform sacrifices in his name. 
118. King Xerxes grieved for Artachaees' death. Meanwhile, the Greeks who hosted Xerxes' army and entertained the king himself faced extreme hardship, forcing them to leave their homes. For example, the Thasians, who hosted and feasted Xerxes' army on behalf of their mainland towns, were left with a huge expense. Antipatrus, son of Orgeus and a prominent man in his town, was chosen for this task and reported that they had spent four hundred silver talents on the dinner. 
119. The officers in other towns reported similar expenses. The dinner, which had been planned and prepared for a long time, was organized as follows: As soon as the townspeople received the announcement from the herald, they divided the corn among themselves in their cities. For many months, they ground it into wheat and barley meal. They also raised the finest animals money could buy and kept land and water birds in cages and ponds for the army's entertainment. Additionally, they made gold and silver cups, bowls, and various tableware for the king and those who dined with him. For the rest of the army, they only provided food. A tent was always prepared for Xerxes to rest in when the army arrived, while the soldiers camped outside. The real challenge for the hosts began at dinner time. After eating and spending the night there, the army would dismantle the tent the next day and march off with all the belongings, leaving nothing behind and taking everything with them. 
120. A wise comment was made by Megacreon from Abdera during this time. He suggested that his fellow townspeople, both men and women, should gather at their temples and humbly ask the gods to protect them from half of any future troubles. He also advised them to express their gratitude to the gods for their past kindness. This was because Xerxes only ate one meal a day, so they didn't have to provide a breakfast similar to the dinner. If they had to do so, the people of Abdera would have had no choice but to flee before Xerxes' arrival or face terrible suffering if they stayed. 
121. Despite their difficulties, the townspeople followed the orders given to them. When Xerxes left Acanthus, he sent his ships away and instructed his generals to have the fleet wait for him at Therma, a town on the Thermaic Gulf, which gave the gulf its name. He learned that this was the shortest route. The arrangement of the army's march from Doriscus to Acanthus was as follows: Xerxes divided his entire land army into three parts. One part marched along the coast beside his fleet, with Mardonius and Masistes as its generals. Another third of the army marched further inland, led by Tritantaechmes and Gergis. The final part, which included Xerxes himself, marched between the other two groups, with Smerdomenes and Megabyzus as its generals. 
122. After the fleet left Xerxes, it sailed through the Athos canal, which led to the gulf where the towns of Assa, Pilorus, Singus, and Sarte were located. The fleet picked up troops from all these cities and then headed for the Thermaic Gulf. Next, it rounded Ampelus, the headland of Torone, and passed the Greek towns of Torone, Galepsus, Sermyle, Mecyberna, and Olynthus, all of which provided ships and men. 
123. This region is known as Sithonia. The fleet sailed straight from the Ampelus headland to the Canastraean headland, where Pallene extends farthest into the sea. They received ships and men from the towns in what is now called Pallene but was once known as Phlegra, including Potidaea, Aphytis, Neapolis, Aege, Therambus, Scione, Mende, and Sane. As they sailed along the coast, they headed for the designated place, picking up troops from towns near Pallene and the Thermaic Gulf, such as Lipaxus, Combrea, Aesa, Gigonus, Campsa, Smila, and Aenea. The area of these cities is still called Crossaea today. From Aenea, the last town mentioned in the list, the fleet's course took them from the Thermaic Gulf itself and through the Mygdonian territory until they reached their destination at Therma. They passed the towns of Sindus and Chalestra, arriving at the river Axius, which serves as the boundary between the Mygdonian and Bottiaean territories. The towns of Ichnae and Pella are located on the narrow strip of coast in this area. 
124. The fleet waited near the river Axius, the city of Therma, and the towns in between, for the king to arrive. Meanwhile, Xerxes and his land army marched from Acanthus, taking the most direct inland route towards Therma. They passed through the Paeonian and Crestonaean territories, reaching the river Cheidorus. This river originates in the Crestonaean land, flows through the Mygdonian region, and finally empties into the marshes of the Axius. 
125. While Xerxes traveled along this path, lions attacked the camels carrying his supplies. Every night, the lions would come down from their hiding places and target only the camels, leaving the people and other animals unharmed. It's surprising that the lions didn't touch anything other than the camels, which were animals they had never seen or encountered before. 
126. In this area, there are many lions and wild oxen with very long horns, like the ones brought to Greece. The lions' territory is bordered by the river Nestus, which runs through Abdera, and the river Achelous, which runs through Acarnania. Lions are not found to the east of the Nestus in the nearby parts of Europe, nor to the west of the Achelous on the rest of the mainland. However, they can be seen in the region between these two rivers. 
127. Upon arriving at Therma, Xerxes set up camp for his army. The campsite stretched from Therma and the Mygdonian region to the rivers Lydias and Haliacmon, which merge into one stream, forming the border between Bottiaean and Macedonian territories. This was where the foreign troops were stationed. Among the rivers mentioned, only the Cheidorus, which flows from the Crestonaean region, couldn't provide enough drinking water for the army and was completely depleted by them. 
128. When Xerxes saw the towering Thessalian mountains, Olympus and Ossa, from Therma and learned that the Peneus river flows through a narrow pass between them, which led into Thessaly, he wanted to see the mouth of the Peneus. He planned to march along the upper road through the highland people of Macedonia to the Perrhaebi region and the town of Gonnus, as he was told this was the safest route. He did just as he wished, boarding a Sidonian ship that he often used for such tasks, and signaled for the rest of the fleet to set sail, while his land army stayed behind. When he arrived at the mouth of the Peneus, he was amazed by the sight and asked his guides if it was possible to redirect the river's flow and lead it into the sea through another path. 
129. According to tradition, Thessaly was once a lake surrounded by tall mountains. To the east, it was enclosed by the lower parts of the Pelion and Ossa mountains, to the north by Olympus, to the west by Pindus, and to the south by Othrys. In the center of this circle of mountains lies the valley of Thessaly. Several rivers flow into this valley, the most notable being Peneus, Apidanus, Onochonus, Enipeus, and Pamisus. These five rivers flow from the surrounding mountains and keep their individual names until they merge and flow into the sea through a narrow passage. Once they join, the name Peneus takes over, leaving the others nameless.  In ancient times, it is said that this channel did not exist, and the rivers, along with the Boebean lake, had the same amount of water as they do now, turning all of Thessaly into a sea. The Thessalians believe that Poseidon created the passage through which the Peneus flows. This makes sense, as those who believe that Poseidon is the shaker of the earth and that earthquake rifts are his work would conclude that the passage was created by him. It was clear to me that an earthquake must have forced the mountains apart. 
130. Xerxes asked his guides if there was another way for the Peneus river to flow into the sea. They confidently replied, "There is no other way, O king, except this one, because Thessaly is surrounded by a ring of mountains." Hearing this, Xerxes said, "The Thessalians are wise; this is why they took precautions long ago and changed their minds for the better. They realized that their land could be easily and quickly conquered. All one would have to do is block the river's channel with a dam and redirect its flow, causing the entire Thessaly region, except for the mountains, to be flooded." Xerxes said this, especially thinking about the sons of Aleues, the Thessalians who were the first Greeks to surrender to the king. He believed that when they offered their friendship, they spoke for their entire nation. After saying this and seeing what he wanted to see, Xerxes sailed back to Therma. 
131. Xerxes spent several days in the Pieria region while a third of his army worked on clearing a path through the Macedonian mountains. This would allow the entire army to pass through and reach the Perrhaebian region. During this time, the heralds who had been sent to Greece to request earth and water returned, some empty-handed and others carrying the requested items. 
132. Among those who paid tribute were the Thessalians, Dolopes, Enienes, Perrhaebians, Locrians, Magnesians, Melians, Achaeans of Phthia, Thebans, and all the Boeotians, except for the people of Thespiae and Plataea. The Greeks who decided to fight against the invaders made a sworn agreement with each other. The agreement stated that if they won the war, they would dedicate the belongings of all Greeks who willingly surrendered to the Persians to the god of Delphi. This was the promise made by the Greeks. 
133. Xerxes didn't send any messengers to Athens and Sparta to ask for earth and water, and there was a reason for this. When Darius had previously sent people for the same purpose, the Athenians threw them into a pit, while the Spartans threw them into a well. They told the messengers to get the earth and water for the king from those places. I can't say for sure what disaster struck the Athenians for treating the messengers this way, other than their land and city being destroyed. However, I think there was another reason for this, not just the one mentioned. 
134. In any case, the anger of Talthybius, Agamemnon's herald, affected the people of Sparta. In Sparta, there is a shrine dedicated to Talthybius, and his descendants, called Talthybiadae, have the special privilege of leading all Spartan embassies. After the incident mentioned earlier, the Spartans struggled to receive good omens from their sacrifices for a long time. This saddened and worried the Lacedaemonians, who often held meetings and announced that they were looking for a volunteer to sacrifice their life for Sparta. Two wealthy and noble-born Spartans, Sperthias, son of Aneristus, and Bulis, son of Nicolaus, decided on their own to make amends to Xerxes for the killing of Darius' messengers in Sparta. As a result, the Spartans sent these two men to Media to be executed. 
135. The actions and words of these men were truly admirable. On their way to Susa, they met Hydarnes, a Persian general in charge of the Asian coast. He invited them to a feast and asked them, "Lacedaemonians, why do you avoid the king's friendship? You can see from my situation how well the king rewards worthy men. If you would just submit to the king, you could be honored like me, and each of you could rule over Hellas." The Spartans replied, "Hydarnes, your advice is not entirely wise; half of it is based on knowledge, but the other half on ignorance. You know how to be a slave, but since you've never experienced freedom, you don't know if it's sweet or not. If you could taste freedom, you would advise us to fight for it not just with spears, but with axes." 
136. This was their response to Hydarnes. When they arrived in Susa and met the king, the guards ordered them to bow down to him. They refused, saying they would never do that, even if they were forced. They explained that it wasn't their custom to bow to mortal men, and that wasn't the reason for their visit. They then said, "The Lacedaemonians have sent us, O king of the Medes, to make amends for the death of your messengers in Sparta." Xerxes responded generously, saying he wouldn't act like the Lacedaemonians. "You," he said, "broke all human laws by killing messengers, but I won't do what I criticize you for. I won't free the Lacedaemonians from their guilt by killing you in return." 
137. The actions of the Spartans temporarily calmed the anger of Talthybius, even though Sperthias and Bulis returned to Sparta. However, the Lacedaemonians say that Talthybius' anger resurfaced during the war between the Peloponnesians and Athenians, which seems to me a sign of divine intervention. It was fitting that Talthybius' wrath fell upon ambassadors and didn't stop until it was satisfied. The fact that his anger affected the sons of those who tried to appease him, Nicolas, son of Bulis, and Aneristus, son of Sperthias, shows that this was a result of Talthybius' divine anger. These two were sent as ambassadors to Asia by the Lacedaemonians, but they were betrayed by the Thracian king Sitalces, son of Tereus, and Nymphodorus, son of Pytheas of Abdera. They were captured at Bisanthe on the Hellespont and taken to Attica, where the Athenians executed them along with Aristeas, son of Adimantus, a Corinthian. This event happened many years after the king's expedition, and now I return to the main story. 
138. The king claimed that his march was to attack Athens, but in reality, he aimed to conquer all of Greece. The Greeks had known this for a long time, but they had different reactions. Those who had submitted to the Persian by offering earth and water felt confident that they would be safe. However, those who had refused to pay tribute were afraid, as there were not enough Greek ships to fight against the invading forces. Moreover, many of them were not eager to face the war and were quickly considering joining the Persian side. 
139. I must express an opinion that may not be popular, but I cannot hold back from saying what I believe to be true. If the Athenians had been terrified by the impending danger and abandoned their country, or even if they had stayed and surrendered to Xerxes, no one would have tried to resist the king at sea. It's easy to predict what would have happened on land if no one had challenged the king at sea. Even though the Peloponnesians had built several walls across the Isthmus for their defense, they would have been abandoned by their allies, who would have had no choice but to watch their cities fall one by one to the foreign fleet. Eventually, the Peloponnesians would have been left alone, either fighting bravely and dying nobly or making a deal with Xerxes. In either case, Greece would have been conquered by the Persians, as the walls across the Isthmus would have been useless while the king ruled the seas. However, it is accurate to say that the Athenians were the saviors of Greece. They held the power to tip the balance, and whichever side they chose was destined to win. By deciding that Greece should remain free, the Athenians rallied the other Greek states that had not yet sided with the Persians and, with the help of the gods, drove the king away. They did not abandon Greece despite the frightening oracles from Delphi that deeply troubled them. Instead, they stood strong and bravely faced the invader of their country. 
140. The Athenians had sent messages to Delphi requesting an oracle, and after performing all the necessary rituals at the temple and sitting in the inner hall, the priestess named Aristonice gave them this response: "Why are you still here? Flee from your homes and city, escape to the farthest corners of the earth, away from Athens! Your city will not remain intact; everything will be destroyed. Fire and the relentless god of war, riding a Syrian chariot, will bring you down." "He will also destroy many other fortresses, not just yours, and many sacred places will be consumed by flames. The gods are sweating with fear and trembling at the enemy's approach, and their temples will be drenched in blood, anticipating their sorrow. So, I urge you to leave this sanctuary and find the courage to face your misfortune." 
141. When the Athenian messengers heard the oracle's response, they were extremely disheartened and felt doomed due to the terrible prediction. However, Timon, son of Androbulus, a prominent Delphian, advised them to approach the oracle a second time with branches of supplication, as if begging for mercy. The Athenians followed his advice and said, "Lord, please look kindly upon these humble branches we bring to you, and give us a more favorable answer about our country. If not, we will not leave your temple and will stay here until we die." Then, the priestess gave them this second oracle: "Pallas tries in vain to persuade great Zeus of Olympus; words of pleading are useless, as are clever plans of wisdom. Still, I will tell you again about the unbreakable strength. Everything within the sacred borders of Cecrops and the divine valleys of Cithaeron will be taken and lost. But Zeus, the all-seeing, will grant a wooden wall to the Trito-born, a fortress for you and your children." "Do not wait for the army of horsemen and foot soldiers coming from Asia, but instead, turn your back and retreat from the enemy. A day will come when you will face them directly. Divine Salamis, you will bring death to the sons of women when the corn is sown or the harvest is gathered." 
142. This response seemed more compassionate than the first, and the envoys wrote it down and returned to Athens. When the messengers shared the oracle with the people, there was much debate about its meaning. Among the many opinions expressed, two opposing interpretations stood out. Some of the older men believed that the oracle meant the acropolis would be saved, as in ancient times, it had been protected by a thorn hedge, which they thought was the wooden wall. Others believed that the god was referring to their ships and that they should focus on preparing them for battle. Those who believed the ships were the wooden wall were confused by the last two lines of the oracle: "Divine Salamis, you will bring death to women's sons when the corn is scattered, or the harvest gathered in." These lines led those who thought the ships were the wooden wall to believe that they would engage in a sea battle near Salamis and be defeated there. 
143. There was an Athenian named Themistocles, son of Neocles, who had recently become one of their prominent leaders. He argued that the interpreters of the oracle had misunderstood its meaning and reasoned that if the verse truly referred to the Athenians, it would have used harsher language, calling Salamis "cruel" instead of "divine," since its inhabitants were to die. According to Themistocles, the oracle was actually about their enemies, not the Athenians, and he advised them to believe that their ships were the wooden wall and prepare for a sea battle. When Themistocles presented this interpretation, the Athenians considered him a better advisor than the oracle interpreters, who had suggested they avoid a sea battle and not resist at all, but instead abandon Attica and settle in another country. 
144. Themistocles' advice had been successful before. The income from the mines at Laurium had brought significant wealth to the Athenians, and when each person was supposed to receive ten drachmas, Themistocles convinced them to use the money to build two hundred ships for war, specifically against Aegina. This conflict eventually benefited Greece by forcing the Athenians to become skilled sailors. The ships were not used for their original purpose but later served Greece in her time of need. These ships were already available for the Athenians, and now they needed to build even more. After discussing the oracle, they decided to trust the god and confront the foreign invader of Greece with the full strength of their fleet, ships, and men, along with any other Greeks who were willing to join them. 
145. These oracles had been given to the Athenians. All the Greeks who cared about the well-being of Greece came together for a conference and exchanged promises. They agreed to put an end to all their conflicts and wars against each other, regardless of the reasons behind them. At that time, the most significant ongoing conflict was between the Athenians and the Aeginetans. When they learned that Xerxes was in Sardis with his army, they decided to send spies to Asia to gather information about the king's actions. They also planned to send messengers to various places: to Argos, to ask the Argives to join them in fighting the Persians; to Gelon, son of Dinomenes in Sicily; to Corcyra, to request help for Greece; and to Crete. They did this hoping that since the danger threatened all Greeks, everyone of Greek origin would unite and work together for a common goal. Gelon's power was said to be immense, far surpassing any other power in Greece. 
146. Having made their decision and resolved their disputes, they first sent three men as spies to Asia. These spies went to Sardis and observed the king's army. However, they were discovered and brought before the generals of the land army for questioning. They were sentenced to death, but when Xerxes heard about it, he disagreed with his generals' decision and sent some of his guards to bring the spies to him if they were still alive. The spies were found alive and brought before the king. Xerxes asked them about the purpose of their visit and then ordered his guards to show them his entire army. Once the spies had seen everything they wanted, they were to be released unharmed and allowed to go to any country they wished. 
147. The reason given for Xerxes' command was this: if the spies had been killed, the Greeks would not have learned about the incredible size of his power so quickly, and the Persians would not have caused much harm to their enemy by killing just three men. Xerxes believed that if the spies returned to Greece, the Greeks would hear about his power and give up their freedom before the invasion, making it unnecessary to march against them. This was similar to another incident involving Xerxes when he was in Abydos and saw ships carrying corn from the Black Sea through the Hellespont, heading towards Aegina and the Peloponnese. His advisors, noticing that the ships belonged to their enemies, wanted to capture them and looked to the king for orders. Xerxes, however, asked them where the ships were going, and they replied, "To your enemies, Sire, carrying corn." Xerxes then said, "Aren't we also sailing to the same places as they, with corn among all our other supplies? What harm are they doing to us by carrying food there?" 
148. The spies were sent back after they had seen everything and returned to Europe. After sending the spies, the Greeks who had formed an alliance against the Persians sent messengers to Argos. The Argives claim that they were already aware that the foreigner was planning to wage war against Greece. When they learned that the Greeks would seek their help against the Persians, they sent messengers to Delphi to ask the god for advice on how to act, as six thousand of them had recently been killed by a Lacedaemonian army led by Cleomenes, son of Anaxandrides. This, they said, was the reason for sending the messengers. The priestess at Delphi gave this response to their question: "Hated by your neighbors, dear to the immortals, crouch with a lance in rest, like a warrior protected by his armor, guarding your head from the blow, and the head will shelter the body." This answer had already been given when the envoys arrived in Argos and entered the council chamber to deliver their message. The Argives replied that they would do as requested if they could first make a thirty-year peace with Lacedaemonia and if they were given command of half the allied forces. They believed they had the right to full command, but they would be satisfied with half. 
149. The Argives say that this was the response of their council, even though the oracle advised them not to form an alliance with the Greeks. Despite their fear of the oracle, they were eager to secure a thirty-year treaty so that their children would have time to grow into adults during those years. They reasoned that if there were no such treaty and the Persians dealt them another blow after the misfortune they had already experienced, they might be at the mercy of the Lacedaemonians. The Spartan envoys replied to the council's demands, saying that they would refer the question of the truce to their own government at home. Regarding the command, however, they had been instructed to say that the Spartans had two kings, while the Argives had only one. It was impossible to deprive either Spartan king of his command, but there was nothing to prevent the Argive king from having the same voting rights as the two Spartan kings. At this point, the Argives decided that the Spartans' greed was unbearable and that it would be better to be ruled by foreigners than to give in to the Lacedaemonians. They then told the envoys to leave the land of Argos before sunset, or they would be treated as enemies. 
150. The Argives have their own account of this matter, but there is another story told in Greece. It is said that before Xerxes began his march against Greece, he sent a messenger to Argos. Upon arrival, the messenger said, "Men of Argos, King Xerxes has a message for you. We believe that our ancestor Perses was the son of Perseus, son of Danae, and Andromeda, daughter of Cepheus. If this is true, then we are related to your people. It would be wrong for us to attack our ancestral land, and you should not become our enemies by helping others or doing anything other than remaining peaceful. If everything goes as I wish, I will value you above all others." The Argives were deeply moved by this message, and although they did not immediately make any promises or demands, they later claimed a share when the Greeks were trying to gain their support. They did this because they knew that the Lacedaemonians would refuse to grant it, and this would give them an excuse not to participate in the war. 
151. Some Greeks say that a related event happened many years later, which supports this story. It is said that while Athenian envoys, including Callias son of Hipponicus, were at Susa (also known as the Memnonian) for some other business, the Argives had also sent envoys to Susa at the same time. They asked Xerxes' son, Artoxerxes, whether the friendship they had established with Xerxes still stood, as they hoped, or if he considered them as enemies. Artoxerxes replied that the friendship indeed remained strong, and he believed that no city was a better friend to him than Argos. 
152. Whether it is true that Xerxes sent a herald with such a message to Argos, and that the Argive envoys went to Susa and asked Artoxerxes about their friendship, I cannot say for certain. I only consider the Argives' own account to be true. However, I do know this: if everyone were to bring their personal troubles to the market to exchange with their neighbors, there wouldn't be a single person who, after seeing the troubles of others, wouldn't be happy to take back their own problems. So, the actions of the Argives were not entirely disgraceful. As for me, it is my job to record what I am told, but it is not my responsibility to believe it. I ask the reader to keep this in mind throughout my entire history. There is another story that suggests the Argives invited the Persians into Greece because their war with the Lacedaemonians was going poorly, and they would prefer any alternative to their current difficulties. 
153. The story of the Argives ends here. As for Sicily, the allies sent envoys there to talk with Gelon, including Syagrus from Lacedaemon. Gelon's ancestor, who settled in Gela, came from the island of Telos near Triopium. He joined the founding of Gela by Antiphemus and the Lindians of Rhodes, not wanting to be left behind. His descendants eventually became and still are priests of the goddesses of the underworld. This position was won by one of their ancestors, Telines, as I will explain. There were some Geloans who had lost in political conflicts and were exiled to the town of Mactorium, inland from Gela. Telines brought these men back to Gela without any force, but with the help of the sacred objects of the goddesses' worship. I cannot say where he got these objects or if he made them up himself. However, he relied on them to restore the exiles, on the condition that his descendants would serve as priests of the goddesses. It amazes me that Telines could achieve such a feat, as I always thought that only those with courage and strength could do so. However, the people of Sicily say that Telines had a gentle and delicate nature. 
154. When Cleandrus, son of Pantares, who had been the ruler of Gela for seven years, was killed by a man from that city named Sabyllus, the power passed to Cleandrus' brother, Hippocrates. During Hippocrates' rule, Gelon, a descendant of the priest Telines, was part of Hippocrates' guard, along with Aenesidemus, son of Pataecus, and many others. Due to his worth, Gelon was soon appointed as the leader of the entire cavalry. He had shown great skill while serving under Hippocrates in attacks against Callipolis, Naxos, Zancle, Leontini, Syracuse, and many other foreign towns. None of these cities, except for Syracuse, escaped being conquered by Hippocrates. The Syracusans were defeated in a battle near the Elorus River. However, they were saved by the Corinthians and Corcyraeans, who made a peace agreement for them on the condition that the Syracusans would give up Camarina, which had previously been theirs, to Hippocrates. 
155. When Hippocrates, who had ruled for the same number of years as his brother Cleandrus, died near the town of Hybla while fighting against the Sicels, Gelon pretended to support Hippocrates' sons, Euclides and Cleandrus, whose rule the citizens could no longer tolerate. However, after defeating the men of Gela, Gelon removed Hippocrates' sons from power and took control himself. Following this success, Gelon brought back the so-called landed gentry of Syracuse, who had been exiled by the common people, and their slaves, the Cyllyrians, from the town of Casmena to Syracuse. He then took possession of that city as well, as the Syracusan common people surrendered themselves and the city to Gelon upon his arrival. 
156. After taking control of Syracuse, Gelon focused less on ruling Gela, which he entrusted to his brother Hiero. He concentrated on governing Syracuse, and the city quickly grew and prospered. Gelon not only brought all the people of Camarina to Syracuse and granted them citizenship, but he also did the same for more than half of the residents of Gela, after demolishing the town of Camarina. When the Megarians in Sicily surrendered to him after a siege, Gelon took the wealthier citizens, who had 
157. Gelon had become a powerful ruler through his actions, and when the Greek envoys arrived in Syracuse, they met with him and said: "The Lacedaemonians and their allies have sent us to ask for your help against the foreign invader. We believe you are aware of the Persian who plans to invade Greece, intending to build a bridge over the Hellespont and lead all the forces of the East from Asia against us. He openly claims to be targeting Athens, but his true goal is to conquer all of Greece.  As a ruler of Sicily, you have significant power and control over an important part of Greece. We urge you to support those who are fighting for Greece's freedom and help them in their efforts. If all Greeks unite, we can gather a strong army capable of facing our invaders. However, if some betray us and others refuse to help, the remaining loyal parts of Greece may be too small to resist, and all Greek lands could be destroyed.  Do not think that if the Persian defeats us and conquers Greece, he will leave you alone. Instead, consider your own situation before that day comes. Help us, and you will be defending your own interests. In general, a well-planned strategy leads to a successful outcome." 
158. The envoys spoke, and Gelon responded passionately: "Men of Greece, you have come here with a self-serving request, asking me to join you against the foreign invaders. But what about you? When I was in conflict with the Carchedonians and asked for your help against a foreign army, when I wanted you to avenge the death of Dorieus, son of Anaxandrides, on the people of Egesta, and when I promised to free the trading ports that greatly benefit you, you didn't come to my aid or avenge Dorieus' death. Because of your actions, these lands are now under foreign control. But let's put that aside; everything turned out well, and our state improved. Now that war has come to you, it's time to remember Gelon! Despite your previous disregard for me, I won't hold it against you. I am willing to send 200 triremes, 20,000 soldiers, 2,000 horsemen, 2,000 archers, 2,000 slingers, and 2,000 light-armed men to support the cavalry. I also promise to provide food for the entire Greek army until the war is over. However, I will only do this on one condition: that I am the general and leader of the Greeks against the foreign invaders. I will not come or send help under any other circumstances." 
159. Upon hearing this, Syagrus couldn't hold back his emotions and exclaimed, "Agamemnon, son of Pelops, would surely be devastated to learn that the Spartans had lost their leadership to Gelon and his Syracusans! No, we cannot even consider giving up our command to you. If you truly want to help Greece, you must follow the Lacedaemonians' lead. But if, as I suspect, you are too proud to obey, then don't send any help at all." 
160. Gelon, noticing the hostility in Syagrus' words, calmly shared his thoughts: "My Spartan friend, harsh words can easily provoke anger, but despite your arrogance, I won't respond inappropriately. You value the command highly, so it's reasonable for me to consider it even more important since I lead a much larger army and have far more ships. However, given your prideful response, I'm willing to compromise on my initial condition. We could have you command the army while I lead the fleet, or if you prefer to lead at sea, I can take charge of the army. You should be satisfied with this, unless you'd rather leave without the support of allies like us." 
161. Gelon made his offer, and the Athenian envoy replied before the Lacedaemonian could speak: "King of the Syracusans, Greece sent us to ask for an army, not a leader. However, you insist on leading Greece's forces as a condition for sending your army. Since you wanted to lead the entire force, we Athenians remained silent, knowing the Laconian could answer for both of us. But now, since you couldn't get the overall command, you want to lead the fleet. We need to clarify the situation. Even if the Laconian allows you to command the fleet, we won't, because the fleet's command belongs to us if the Lacedaemonians don't want it. We won't oppose them if they want to lead, but we won't let anyone else be the admiral. It would be pointless for us Athenians to have the largest number of sailors in Greece if we gave up our command to the Syracusans. We can trace our lineage back the furthest and are the only Greeks who have never changed our place of residence. The poet Homer even said that one of our ancestors was the best at organizing and leading armies during the Trojan War. So, we can't be blamed for what we're saying now." 
162. Gelon responded, "My Athenian friend, it appears that you have many leaders but no followers. Since you won't compromise and insist on having everything, it's time for you to hurry back home and tell Greece that it has lost its spring." What Gelon meant was that his army was the most significant part of the Greek forces, just like spring is the best part of the year. So, he compared Greece without his alliance to a year without its spring. 
163. After their conversation with Gelon, the Greek envoys left. Gelon was worried that the Greeks wouldn't be able to defeat the barbarians, and he thought it would be terrible and unbearable for him, as the ruler of Sicily, to go to the Peloponnese and be under the control of the Lacedaemonians. So, he abandoned that plan and pursued another one. When he learned that the Persian had crossed the Hellespont, he sent Cadmus, son of Scythes, a man from Cos, to Delphi with three fifty-oared ships carrying money and messages of friendship. Cadmus was to watch the outcome of the battle. If the barbarians won, he would give them the money and offer earth and water on behalf of Gelon's territories. However, if the Greeks were victorious, he would bring everything back. 
164. Cadmus had previously inherited the rule of Cos from his father. Even though he had a stable position, he voluntarily handed over the government to the people of Cos, not because of any danger, but out of a sense of fairness. He then went to Sicily, where the Samians gave him the city of Zancle. He settled there, renaming it Messene. This was the Cadmus whom Gelon sent, due to his reputation for justice. What I'm about to share is one of the many fair acts in Cadmus' life. He had a large amount of wealth entrusted to him by Gelon and could have kept it for himself. However, he chose not to. When the Greeks won the sea battle and Xerxes retreated, Cadmus returned to Sicily with all the money. 
165. The Sicilians, however, tell a different story. They say that even though Gelon would be under Lacedaemonian control, he still would have helped the Greeks if it weren't for Terillus, son of Crinippus, the ruler of Himera. Terillus had been expelled from Himera by Theron, son of Aenesidemus, the powerful ruler of Acragas. At that time, Terillus brought an army of three hundred thousand Phoenicians, Libyans, Iberians, Ligyes, Elisyci, Sardinians, and Cyrnians against Gelon. They were led by Amilcas, son of Annon, the king of the Carchedonians. Terillus convinced Amilcas to help him, partly because of their personal friendship, but mainly through the efforts of Anaxilaus, son of Cretines, the ruler of Rhegium. Anaxilaus had given his own children as hostages to Amilcas and brought him to Sicily to help his father-in-law. Anaxilaus was married to Terillus' daughter, Cydippe. So, because Gelon couldn't help the Greeks, he sent the money to Delphi instead. 
166. The Sicilians also share this story: Gelon and Theron achieved victory over Amilcas, the Carchedonian, in Sicily on the same day that the Greeks defeated the Persians at Salamis. Amilcas was a Carchedonian through his father and a Syracusan through his mother, and he became the king of Carchedon because of his virtues. When the armies clashed and he lost the battle, it is said that he disappeared without a trace. Gelon searched for him everywhere but couldn't find him, dead or alive. 
167. The story told by the Carchedonians themselves seems to have some truth to it. They say that the barbarians fought with the Greeks in Sicily from dawn until late evening (the battle reportedly lasted a long time). During this time, Amilcas stayed in his camp, offering sacrifices and trying to get favorable omens by burning whole bodies on a large pyre. When he saw his army defeated, he threw himself into the fire where he was pouring libations on the sacrifice. He was consumed by the flames and was never seen again. Whether he disappeared as the Phoenicians say, or in the way described by the Carchedonians and Syracusans, sacrifices are offered to him, and monuments have been erected in all the colonists' cities. The largest of these monuments is in Carchedon itself. 
168. This is what happened during the campaign in Sicily. As for the people of Corcyra, their response to the envoys and their actions were as follows. The men who had gone to Sicily also sought help from Corcyra, using the same arguments they had used with Gelon. The Corcyraeans immediately promised to send help and protection, stating that they wouldn't let Greece fall, because if it did, they would be enslaved the very next day. So, they agreed to help as much as they could. While their answer seemed fair, their actions changed when it was time to send help. They prepared sixty ships and set sail towards the coast of the Peloponnese. However, they anchored off Pylos and Taenarus in Lacedaemonian territory, waiting like others to see the outcome of the war. They didn't believe the Greeks would win, but rather thought the Persians would achieve a great victory and rule all of Greece. Their actions were planned so they could tell the Persian king, "We have great power and could have provided as many ships as any state except Athens. But when the Greeks asked for our help in this war, we didn't resist you or do anything to displease you." They hoped this would give them some extra advantage, and it probably would have. However, they also had an excuse ready for the Greeks, which they eventually used. When the Greeks blamed them for not sending help, they said they had prepared sixty triremes, but couldn't get around Malea due to the Etesian winds. They claimed this was the reason they couldn't reach Salamis, not cowardice that made them miss the sea battle. With this excuse, they managed to appease the Greeks. 
169. When the Greeks tried to gain the support of the Cretans, the Cretans responded in the following way. They sent messengers to Delphi to ask if it would be beneficial for them to help the Greeks. The Pythia, the oracle, replied, "Foolish men, wasn't the suffering that Minos brought upon your people for helping Menelaus enough? He was angry that others wouldn't help avenge his death at Camicus, while you helped them avenge the abduction of the woman from Sparta by a barbarian." When the Cretans heard this, they decided not to help the Greeks. 
170. The story goes that Minos traveled to Sicania, now known as Sicily, in search of Daedalus and died a violent death there. Later, all the Cretans, except those from Polichne and Praesus, were instructed by a god to go to Sicania with a large army. They besieged the town of Camicus, where the people of Acragas lived in my time, for five years. Eventually, they couldn't capture the town or stay there due to famine, so they left. While sailing off the coast of Iapygia, a massive storm wrecked their ships and forced them ashore. With no way to return to Crete, they founded the town of Hyria and made it their home, transforming from Cretans to Messapians of Iapygia, and from islanders to mainland dwellers. From Hyria, they established other towns, which the Tarentines tried to destroy much later, resulting in a significant disaster. No one has ever heard of such a massive slaughter of Greeks as that of the Tarentines and Rhegians. Three thousand Rhegian townspeople, forced by Micythus, son of Choerus, to help the Tarentines, were killed, and countless Tarentines were slain. Micythus was a servant of Anaxilaus and had been left in charge of Rhegium. He was later banished from Rhegium and settled in Tegea of Arcadia, where he set up many statues at Olympia. 
171. While discussing the Rhegians and Tarentines, I strayed from the main topic of my story. The Praesians claim that after Crete was left deserted, it was mainly repopulated by Greeks, among other people. In the third generation following Minos, the events of the Trojan War occurred, during which the Cretans fought as bravely as anyone else for Menelaus. After returning from Troy, the Cretans and their livestock suffered from famine and disease, leaving Crete desolate once again. Then, a third wave of Cretans arrived, and they, along with the remaining inhabitants, now live there. The priestess reminded them of this history, which stopped them from helping the Greeks as they initially intended. 
172. The Thessalians initially sided with the Persians, not because they wanted to, but because they had no choice. Their actions showed their dislike for the Aleuadae's plans. When they heard that the Persian was about to invade Europe, they sent messengers to the Isthmus, where representatives from the most pro-Greek cities had gathered to discuss their cause. The Thessalian messengers told them, "People of Hellas, we must protect the pass of Olympus to keep Thessaly and all of Hellas safe from the war. We are willing to guard it with you, but you must also send a large force. If you don't, we will have to make a deal with the Persian, as it's not fair for us to guard it alone and risk our lives for you. If you don't help us, there's nothing you can do to force us, because we can't do more than we're capable of. As for us, we'll try to find a way to save ourselves." These were the words of the Thessalians. 
173. The Greeks decided to send a land army to Thessaly by sea to protect the pass. Once the forces gathered, they sailed through the Euripus and arrived at Alus in Achaea, where they disembarked and headed towards Thessaly, leaving their ships behind. They reached the pass of Tempe, which connects lower Macedonia to Thessaly along the Peneus River, between the Olympus and Ossa mountains. The Greeks set up camp there, with about ten thousand soldiers and cavalry. The Lacedaemonians were led by Euaenetus, son of Carenus, who was chosen from the Polemarchs but not from the royal family, while the Athenians were led by Themistocles, son of Neocles. They only stayed there for a few days because messengers from Alexander, son of Amyntas, the Macedonian, arrived. The messengers warned them about the size of the army and the large number of ships, advising them to leave and not stay there to be crushed by the invading forces. The Greeks followed their advice, believing it to be well-intended and reasonable. However, I think fear also played a role in their decision, as they discovered another pass leading into Thessaly through the Macedonian hills, near the town of Gonnus. This was the route Xerxes' army took to enter Thessaly. The Greeks returned to their ships and sailed back to the Isthmus. 
174. The Greeks went on this expedition to Thessaly while the king was preparing to cross from Asia to Europe and was already in Abydos. Left without their allies, the Thessalians fully and wholeheartedly joined the Persians. As a result, they proved to be very helpful to the king through their actions. 
175. When they arrived at the Isthmus, the Greeks considered Alexander's advice and discussed where they should make their stand to fight. They decided to defend the pass of Thermopylae, as it was narrower than the pass into Thessaly and closer to home. They were unaware of this pass, which later led to the downfall of the Greeks at Thermopylae, until they arrived there and learned about it from the people of Trachis. They were determined to guard this pass and prevent the barbarians from entering Hellas, while their fleet would sail to Artemisium in the territory of Histiaea. These locations were close to each other, allowing each force to stay informed about the other's actions. Now, let me describe the nature of these places. 
176. Artemisium is a place where the wide Thracian sea narrows down, creating a small passage between the island of Sciathus and the mainland of Magnesia. This strait leads to Artemisium, a beach on the coast of Euboea, where a temple of Artemis stands. The pass through Trachis into Hellas is only fifty feet wide at its narrowest point. However, the narrowest part is not here, but in front of Thermopylae and behind it; at Alpeni, which lies behind, it is only as wide as a cart-way, and it is the same at the Phoenix stream, near the town of Anthele. To the west of Thermopylae, there is a high, steep, and inaccessible mountain, which is a part of Oeta; to the east of the road, there are only marshes and sea. In this pass, there are warm springs for bathing, called the Basins by the locals, and an altar of Heracles stands nearby. A wall had been built across this entrance, and there used to be a gate in it. The Phocians built this wall to protect themselves from the Thessalians when they moved from Thesprotia to the Aeolian land, the area they now inhabit. As the Thessalians tried to conquer them, the Phocians used this wall as a defense and diverted the stream from the hot springs into the pass to create a watercourse. The ancient wall had been built a long time ago, and most of it was in ruins; those who rebuilt it believed that they could block the foreigner's entry into Hellas this way. There is a village called Alpeni very close to the road, and the Greeks expected to get provisions from there. 
177. The Greeks believed that these locations were suitable for their needs. After carefully examining the area, they determined that the barbarians wouldn't be able to use their entire army or their cavalry effectively. So, they decided to confront the invaders of Hellas at these places. When they learned that the Persian forces were in Pieria, they left the Isthmus and moved their army to Thermopylae and their fleet to Artemisium. 
178. The Greeks quickly set off in different directions to face the enemy. Meanwhile, the Delphians, who were worried about themselves and Hellas, sought advice from the god. They were told to pray to the winds, as they would be powerful allies for Hellas. After receiving the oracle, the Delphians first shared the message with the Greeks who wanted to be free, and they were forever grateful due to their fear of the barbarians. Later, they built an altar to the winds at Thyia, where the current shrine of Thyia, the daughter of Cephisus, is located, and they made sacrifices to the winds. That's why, even today, the Delphians continue to offer sacrifices to the winds as a way of showing gratitude. 
179. Xerxes' fleet departed from the city of Therma, and the ten fastest ships headed directly for Sciathus, where a small group of three Greek ships from Troezen, Aegina, and Athens were stationed. Upon seeing the foreign ships approaching, the Greek ships quickly retreated. 
180. The ship from Troezen, led by Captain Prexinus, was chased and immediately captured by the enemy. They selected the strongest fighter among the captives and killed him by cutting his throat on the ship's front, believing that sacrificing the best and most attractive Greek prisoner would bring them good luck. The man who was sacrificed was named Leon, and it's possible that his name played a role in his unfortunate fate. 
181. The Aeginetan trireme, captained by Asonides, put up a tough fight. Aboard this ship was Pytheas, son of Ischenous, who fought bravely that day. Even after his ship was captured, he continued to fight until he was severely injured. Despite his injuries, he was still alive, and the Persian soldiers on the ship admired his courage. They carefully treated his wounds with ointments and wrapped him in linen bandages. When they returned to their base, they proudly showed him to the entire army, treating him with respect and kindness. However, the rest of the captives from that ship were forced into slavery. 
182. So, two of the ships were captured, and the third trireme, led by Phormus, an Athenian, ran aground while trying to escape at the mouth of the Peneus River. The enemy seized the ship but not the crew, as the Athenians quickly abandoned the vessel and traveled through Thessaly to reach Athens. 
183. The Greeks stationed at Artemisium received news of these events through signal fires from Sciathus. Alarmed by this, they moved their ships from Artemisium to Chalcis, planning to guard the Euripus Strait and leaving lookouts on the hills of Euboea. Three of the ten enemy ships crashed into a reef called the Ant, located between Sciathus and Magnesia. The invaders then placed a stone pillar on the reef to mark its location, and with a clear path ahead, the entire fleet set sail from Therma, eleven days after the king had left. Pammon of Scyros guided them through the strait, showing them the location of the reef. After sailing all day, the foreign fleet arrived at Sepias in Magnesia, on the shore between the town of Casthanaea and the Sepiad headland. 
184. The entire army reached this location and Thermopylae without any harm, and my calculations show that their numbers were as follows: There were 1,207 ships from Asia, and with all the nations involved, there were a total of 241,400 men, with 200 men assigned to each ship. On all these ships, there were an additional 30 Persian, Mede, and Sacae fighters, along with their native troops. This added 36,210 more soldiers. I also include the crews of the 50-oared ships, estimating 80 men per ship, whether there were more or fewer. With 3,000 of these vessels gathered, there must have been 240,000 men on them. So, the total number of troops from Asia was 517,610. There were also 700,100 infantry and 80,000 cavalry, and I add 20,000 Arabian camel-riders and Libyan charioteers to this number. Combining the sea and land forces, there were 2,317,610 soldiers. This count only includes the forces from Asia, not the support staff and grain transport ships that accompanied them. 
185. I must also consider the forces brought from Europe, and I will use my best judgment to do so. The Greeks of Thrace and the nearby islands provided 120 ships, which would mean there were 24,000 crew members. As for the land army contributed by all the nations—Thracians, Paeonians, Eordi, Bottiaei, Chalcidians, Brygi, Pierians, Macedonians, Perrhaebi, Enienes, Dolopes, Magnesians, Achaeans, and those living along the coast of Thrace—I estimate their combined number to be 300,000. Adding these figures to the numbers from Asia, the total count of fighting men is 2,641,610. 
186. Here is the number of soldiers. As for the support staff that followed them, the crews of the grain-carrying ships, and all the other vessels that came by sea with the force, I believe their numbers were not less, but rather more than the fighting men. However, let's assume they were equal in number, neither more nor fewer. If they were equal to the fighting force, they would make up the same number of tens of thousands as the others. So, the total number of people that Xerxes, son of Darius, led up to the Sepiad headland and Thermopylae was 5,283,220. 
187. Here is the total number of Xerxes' forces. However, no one can accurately say how many cooks, concubines, and eunuchs were present, nor can anyone determine the number of draft animals, pack animals, and Indian dogs that accompanied the army; there were just too many. So, it's not surprising to me that some water sources ran dry. However, I do wonder how there were enough provisions for so many thousands of people. My calculations show that if each man received one choenix of wheat per day and no more, 1,100,340 bushels would be needed daily. This estimate doesn't include provisions for women, eunuchs, animals, and dogs. Among all those tens of thousands of men, there was no one more suitable in appearance and grandeur to lead the army than Xerxes himself. 
188. The Persian fleet set sail and arrived at the beach in Magnesia, between the city of Casthanaea and the Sepia headland. The first ships to get there anchored close to the shore, while the others followed, forming rows eight ships deep out into the sea. They spent the night like this, but at dawn, a storm suddenly appeared from a clear and calm sky, causing the sea to churn. A strong east wind, known as Hellespontian by the locals, began to blow. Some ships, sensing the wind or having proper mooring, managed to drag themselves onto the shore before the storm hit, saving both the ships and their crews. However, the wind drove other ships caught in the open sea against the rocks called the Ovens at Pelion or onto the beach. Some ships were wrecked on the Sepian headland, while others were washed ashore at the cities of Meliboea or Casthanaea. The storm was truly relentless. 
189. The story goes that the Athenians called upon Boreas, the north wind, to help them because of an oracle's advice. Another oracle had told them to ask for help from their son-in-law. According to Greek mythology, Boreas was married to Orithyia, an Athenian princess and daughter of Erechtheus, an ancient king of Athens. Because of this connection, the Athenians considered Boreas to be their son-in-law. They were positioned near Chalcis in Euboea, and when they saw the storm approaching, they either sacrificed to and called upon Boreas and Orithyia for help or had already done so, asking them to destroy the enemy fleet, just as they had done before at Athos. I cannot say for sure if this was the reason Boreas attacked the enemy ships, but the Athenians believe that he had helped them before and did so again this time. When they returned home, they established a sacred site for Boreas next to the Ilissus river. 
190. It is said that at least 400 ships were destroyed in this disaster, along with countless men and a vast amount of wealth. This shipwreck turned out to be beneficial for Ameinocles, son of Cretines, a man from Magnesia who owned land near Sepia. He later found many gold and silver cups washed up on the shore, discovered Persian treasures, and gained other unimaginable riches. Although he became very wealthy from his discoveries, he didn't have good fortune in all aspects of his life, as he experienced great sorrow when his son was killed. 
191. There was no way to count how many grain ships and other vessels were destroyed. The fleet's generals, fearing an attack from the Thessalians after their defeat, built a tall barrier using the wreckage. The storm continued for three days. Eventually, the Magi made offerings and performed rituals to calm the wind, also sacrificing to Thetis and the Nereids. This made the wind stop on the fourth day—or perhaps it just naturally died down. They sacrificed to Thetis after learning from the Ionians that Peleus had taken her from this place and that the entire Sepia headland belonged to her and the other Nereids. 
192. The storm finally stopped on the fourth day. The scouts positioned on the headlands of Euboea rushed to inform the Greeks about the shipwreck on the second day after the storm started. Upon hearing this, they prayed to Poseidon as their savior and made offerings. Then, they quickly went to Artemisium, hoping to face fewer enemy ships. So, they returned to Artemisium and set up their base there. From that moment on, they referred to Poseidon as their savior. 
193. When the wind stopped and the waves calmed down, the barbarians set sail and followed the coastline of the mainland. They went around the headland of Magnesia and entered the gulf that leads towards Pagasae. There is a place in this gulf in Magnesia where, according to the story, Heracles was sent to fetch water and was left behind by Jason and his fellow Argo crew members. They were on their way to Aea in Colchis to retrieve the Golden Fleece and planned to get water from this place before setting sail again. This is why the place is called Aphetae. Xerxes' men anchored their ships here. 
194. Fifteen of the ships had set sail much later than the rest, and by chance, they spotted the Greek ships near Artemisium. Thinking these were their own fleet, the barbarians sailed right into the midst of their enemies. Their captain was Sandoces, son of Thamasius, the viceroy from Cyme in Aeolia. He was one of the king's judges and had previously been captured and crucified by Darius for accepting a bribe and giving an unjust judgment. However, when Darius realized that Sandoces' good services to the royal house outweighed his offenses, he regretted his hasty decision and set Sandoces free. So, he escaped death at the hands of Darius. But now, as he found himself among the Greeks, he wouldn't escape a second time. When the Greeks saw the Persians approaching, they realized the mistake and quickly set sail, easily capturing them. 
195. In one of the captured ships, they found Aridolis, the ruler of Alabanda in Caria, and in another, they found Penthylus, son of Demonous, the captain from Paphos. Penthylus had brought twelve ships from Paphos, but he lost eleven of them in the storm near the Sepiad headland. He was captured in the only remaining ship as he approached Artemisium. The Greeks questioned these men to gather information about Xerxes' forces. After getting the information they needed, the Greeks sent them, tied up, to the isthmus of Corinth. 
196. The foreign fleet, led by Sandoces, except for fifteen ships, arrived at Aphetae. Meanwhile, Xerxes and his land army marched through Thessaly and Achaea, and it had been three days since they entered Malis. In Thessaly, Xerxes held a race for his cavalry, which also served as a test for the Thessalian horsemen, who were known to be the best in Hellas. However, the Greek horses were easily outperformed in this race. Among the Thessalian rivers, only the Onochonus could not provide enough water for Xerxes' army to drink. In Achaea, even the largest river, the Apidanus, almost dried up, leaving just a small stream. 
197. When Xerxes arrived at Alus in Achaea, his guides shared with him the local story about the worship of Laphystian Zeus. They told him how Athamas, son of Aeolus, conspired with Ino to kill Phrixus, and how the Achaeans, following an oracle's instructions, forced Phrixus' descendants to perform certain tasks. The eldest of the family was forbidden to enter the town hall, which the Achaeans called the People's House, and they kept watch there. If the eldest entered, he could only leave to be sacrificed. The guides also mentioned that many of those who were to be sacrificed had fled to other countries, but if they returned later and were caught, they were brought to the town hall.  The guides explained to Xerxes how the man was sacrificed, covered in ribbons and led by a procession. This treatment was given to the descendants of Phrixus' son, Cytissorus, because when the Achaeans were about to sacrifice Athamas, son of Aeolus, as a scapegoat for their country, Cytissorus saved him, bringing the god's wrath upon his own descendants.  After hearing this story, Xerxes decided not to enter the temple grove himself and ordered his army to do the same, showing respect for both the house and the precinct of Athamas' descendants. 
198. Xerxes' journey continued through Thessaly and Achaea, eventually reaching Malis, which was located along a sea gulf where the tide changed daily. The area around the gulf had low-lying land that sometimes became very narrow, surrounded by tall and unreachable mountains enclosing Malis, known as the Rocks of Trachis. The first town near the gulf, coming from Achaea, was Anticyra, where the river Spercheus flowed from the Enieni region and emptied into the sea. About twenty furlongs from the Spercheus was another river called Dyras, which was believed to have emerged from the ground to help Heracles against the fire that burned him. Another twenty furlongs from Dyras, there was yet another river called the Black River. 
199. The town of Trachis is located five furlongs away from the Black River. In this area, the greatest distance between the sea and the hills where Trachis stands is twenty-two thousand plethra. The mountains surrounding the Trachinian land have a ravine to the south of Trachis, through which the Asopus River flows along the base of the mountains. 
200. South of the Asopus River, there is another small river called the Phoenix, which flows from the nearby mountains into the Asopus. The narrowest part of this area is near the Phoenix River, with just enough space for a single cart to pass. Thermopylae is fifteen furlongs away from the Phoenix River. Between the river and Thermopylae, there is a village called Anthele, through which the Asopus River flows into the sea. Around the village, there is a spacious area that contains a temple dedicated to Amphictyonid Demeter, seating for the Amphictyons, and a temple for Amphictyon himself. 
201. King Xerxes set up camp in Trachis, located in the Malis region, while the Greeks camped in the pass. Most people called this place Thermopylae, but the locals and their neighbors referred to it as Pylae. Both groups were stationed in these locations. Xerxes controlled everything to the north of Trachis, while the Greeks held the territory to the south on the mainland. 
202. The Greeks waiting for the Persians at that location included the following: 300 armed Spartans; 1,000 soldiers from Tegea and Mantinea, with 500 from each place; 120 from Orchomenus in Arcadia and 1,000 from the rest of Arcadia; 400 from Corinth; 200 from Phlius; and 80 Mycenaeans. These were the Peloponnesian soldiers present. Additionally, there were 700 Thespians and 400 Thebans from Boeotia. 
203. Moreover, the Opuntian Locrians arrived in full force, along with 1,000 Phocians who responded to the call for help. The Greeks had sent messengers to inform them that this was just the first group of soldiers, and more allies were expected to arrive soon. They also mentioned that the sea was being guarded by the Athenians, Aeginetans, and others in the fleet, so there was no need to worry. The invader of Greece was not a god, but a human being, and every person had their share of flaws. The greatest individuals often had the most significant weaknesses. The one attacking them would eventually fall due to his pride, as he was only a mortal. Upon hearing this, the Locrians and Phocians marched to Trachis to provide assistance. 
204. Each city had its own leader, but the most admired and the commander of the entire army was a man from Lacedaemonia named Leonidas. He was the son of Anaxandrides, who was the son of Leon, and so on, tracing his lineage back to Heracles. Leonidas became the king of Sparta unexpectedly. 
205. Leonidas had two older brothers, Cleomenes and Dorieus, so he never expected to become king. However, Cleomenes died without a son, and Dorieus passed away in Sicily. As a result, Leonidas became king since he was older than Anaxandrides' youngest son, Cleombrotus, and had married Cleomenes' daughter. He went to Thermopylae with 300 chosen soldiers, all of whom had sons. He also brought Thebans, who were led by Leontiades, the son of Eurymachus. Leonidas made an effort to include only Thebans among the Greeks because they were accused of supporting the Persians. He wanted to see if they would send their men with him or openly refuse to join the Greek alliance. They sent their soldiers, but their intentions were quite different. 
206. The Spartans sent soldiers with Leonidas ahead of time so that the other allies would be encouraged to march, rather than support the Persians if they found out the Spartans were delaying. At that moment, the Carneia festival was taking place, but once it was over, the Spartans planned to leave some troops in Sparta and quickly march out with the rest. The other allies had similar plans, as the Olympic Games were happening at the same time. So, they sent their advance guard, not expecting the battle at Thermopylae to be resolved so quickly. 
207. The Greeks at Thermopylae, upon seeing the approaching Persians, were afraid and discussed whether they should leave. Most of the Peloponnesians wanted to go back to the Peloponnese and protect the isthmus, but the Phocians and Locrians were very upset by this idea. Leonidas decided they should stay put and send messages to other cities asking for reinforcements, as their current numbers were not enough to hold off the Persian army. 
208. While the Greeks were discussing their options, Xerxes sent a scout on horseback to check the size of their army and what they were doing. He had already heard in Thessaly that a small force was gathered there, led by Lacedaemonians, including Leonidas from the Heracleid family. The scout approached the camp and observed the area, but couldn't see the entire camp as some were inside the wall they had rebuilt and were guarding. However, he noticed those outside with their weapons near the wall, and at that moment, the Lacedaemonians were stationed there. He saw some men exercising without clothes and others grooming their hair. Surprised by the sight, he took note of their numbers and carefully observed everything before riding back at a relaxed pace, as no one chased or paid any attention to him. He returned and reported everything he had seen to Xerxes. 
209. When Xerxes heard the scout's report, he couldn't understand why the Lacedaemonians were preparing to fight to the death, and their actions seemed ridiculous to him. So, he called Demaratus, the son of Ariston, who was in his camp. Xerxes asked Demaratus about the Lacedaemonians' actions, wanting to understand their intentions. Demaratus replied, "I already told you about these men when we were heading to Greece, but you laughed at me even though I shared my expectations. My main goal, O King, is to be honest with you. Listen to me now. These men have come to fight for the pass, and they are preparing for it. It's their tradition to groom their hair when they're about to risk their lives. Be certain that if you defeat these men and those left in Sparta, no one else in the world will dare to oppose you, my King. You are attacking the most beautiful kingdom in Greece and the bravest men." Xerxes found Demaratus' words hard to believe, so he asked how such a small group could fight against his vast army. Demaratus responded, "My King, consider me a liar if things don't turn out as I say." Despite his words, Demaratus couldn't convince Xerxes. 
210. Xerxes waited for four days, thinking the Greeks would flee at any moment. However, they didn't leave, and he believed they stayed due to foolishness and disrespect. On the fifth day, he grew angry and sent the Medes and Cissians to capture the Greeks and bring them to him. The Medes charged at the Greeks and a fierce battle ensued. Many soldiers fell, but others continued to fight, proving to everyone, especially King Xerxes, that among the large crowd, there were only a few truly brave men. The battle lasted the entire day. 
211. After the Medes were defeated, they retreated, and the Persian soldiers known as Immortals, led by Hydarnes, took their turn to attack. It was believed that they would easily complete the task. However, when they fought the Greeks, they didn't fare any better than the Medes, as their spears were shorter and their large numbers were useless in the narrow space. The Lacedaemonians fought remarkably, demonstrating their skills against less experienced opponents. At times, they would pretend to flee, causing the barbarians to chase them with loud shouts. But when the Lacedaemonians were caught, they would turn around and face the enemy, defeating countless Persians. A few Spartans were also killed in the process. Unable to make any progress, the Persians tried different tactics, but eventually, they too withdrew. 
212. It is said that during these attacks, King Xerxes, who was watching the battle, jumped up from his throne three times, fearing for his army. The fighting continued in this manner, and on the next day, the barbarians didn't perform any better. They engaged in battle, thinking that the few Greek soldiers would be weakened by injuries and unable to resist. However, the Greeks stood in organized ranks by their regions, and each group took turns fighting, except for the Phocians, who were guarding the mountain path. When the Persians saw that nothing had changed from the previous day, they decided to withdraw. 
213. King Xerxes was unsure how to handle the current situation. A man named Epialtes, the son of Eurydemus from Malis, thought he could earn a great reward from the king. He approached Xerxes and told him about a mountain path that led to Thermopylae. By doing this, he caused the downfall of the remaining Greek soldiers. Fearing the Lacedaemonians, Epialtes later fled to Thessaly. While he was in exile, a bounty was placed on his head by the Pylagori when the Amphictyons gathered at Pylae. Eventually, he returned from exile to Anticyra, where he was killed by a man named Athenades from Trachis. Athenades killed Epialtes for a different reason, which will be explained later in the story. Nonetheless, the Lacedaemonians honored Athenades for his actions. This is how Epialtes met his end. 
214. There is another story that claims Onetes, the son of Phanagoras from Carystus, and Corydallus from Anticyra were the ones who informed King Xerxes about the mountain path and guided the Persians around it. However, I find this hard to believe. The fact that the Pylagori placed a bounty on Epialtes the Trachinian, and not on Onetes and Corydallus, suggests they had accurate information. Moreover, we know that Epialtes was exiled because of this accusation. While Onetes might have known about the path even if he wasn't from Malis, it was Epialtes who led the Persians along the mountain route. I believe it is Epialtes who should be held responsible. 
215. Xerxes was delighted by Epialtes' promise and quickly became overjoyed. He sent Hydarnes and his men, who left the camp around the time lamps were lit. The local Malians had discovered this path earlier and used it to guide the Thessalians into Phocis when the Phocians had built a wall to block the pass and protect themselves from war. The Malians had realized long ago that the pass was not a good thing. 
216. The path starts at the Asopus River, which flows through a narrow valley, and both the mountain and the path are called Anopaea. The Anopaea path runs along the mountain ridge and ends at Alpenus, the city in Locris closest to Malis. The path is at its narrowest point near a rock called Blackbuttock and the seats of the Cercopes. 
217. The pass was like this: The Persians crossed the Asopus River and traveled all night along the path, with the Oetaean mountains on their right and the Trachinian mountains on their left. By dawn, they reached the top of the pass. In this part of the mountain, there were one thousand armed Phocian men on guard, as I mentioned earlier. They were protecting their own land and watching over the path. The lower pass was guarded by the people I mentioned before, but the Phocians had willingly promised Leonidas to keep watch over the mountain path. 
218. The Phocians realized the Persians had climbed up the mountain in the following way: they hadn't noticed the Persians' ascent because the mountain was covered with oak trees. Even though there was no wind, a loud noise like the sound of leaves being stepped on was heard. The Phocians quickly got up and started putting on their weapons, and suddenly, the Persians were there. Seeing the men arming themselves, the Persians were surprised, as they didn't expect any resistance, but now they faced an army.  Hydarnes, worried that the Phocians might be Lacedaemonians, asked Epialtes which country the army was from. Once he was sure of the answer, he prepared the Persians for battle. The Phocians, attacked by a hail of arrows, thought the Persians had targeted them from the beginning, so they fled to the top of the mountain, ready to face their doom. However, the Persians, along with Epialtes and Hydarnes, ignored the Phocians and hurried down the mountain as quickly as possible. 
219. The prophet Megistias, after looking at the sacrifices, was the first to tell the Greeks at Thermopylae that they would face death at dawn. Then, some deserters arrived, informing them about the Persians' secret route. These warnings came during the night, and a third report was brought by the lookouts who came down from the hills at daybreak. The Greeks discussed their options, but they couldn't agree. Some suggested staying at their post, while others disagreed. In the end, they split up - some left and returned to their own cities, while others decided to stay with Leonidas. 
220. People say that Leonidas sent the others away because he worried they would be killed, but he thought it wasn't right for him and the Spartans to abandon the position they initially came to defend. However, I believe that when Leonidas saw the allies were disheartened and unwilling to face the risks with him, he told them to leave. He knew that staying would bring him great fame and protect Sparta's reputation. When the Spartans asked the oracle about the war, the Pythia had predicted that either Lacedaemon would be destroyed by the Persians or their king would die. She gave this response in a poem: "For you, people of Sparta, either your great city will be destroyed by the Persians, or your land will mourn a dead king from Heracles' line. Neither bulls nor lions can stop him, for he has Zeus' power. He won't stop until he completely destroys one of these." Considering this prophecy and wanting to bring honor to the Spartans alone, Leonidas sent the allies away instead of letting them leave in chaos due to their disagreements. 
221. One strong piece of evidence I have for this is that Leonidas openly sent away the prophet who accompanied the expedition, fearing he might die with them. This was Megistias the Acarnanian, believed to be a descendant of Melampus, who predicted their fate through the sacrifices. Although he was told to leave, he didn't go; instead, he sent away his only son who was also part of the army. 
222. The allies who were told to leave followed Leonidas' orders, leaving only the Thespians and Thebans with the Lacedaemonians. The Thebans stayed against their will, as Leonidas kept them as hostages. However, the Thespians happily stayed, declaring they wouldn't abandon Leonidas and his companions; they would stay and die with them. Their leader was Demophilus, the son of Diadromes. 
223. At sunrise, Xerxes performed a ritual and, following Epialtes' advice, waited until mid-morning to attack. This was because the path down the mountain was more direct and shorter than the longer, winding route. Xerxes and his forces attacked, and Leonidas and his Greek soldiers, aware they were facing death, advanced further than before into the wider part of the pass. In the previous days, they had fought in the narrow part of the pass, defending the wall. But now, they fought outside the narrow area, and many of the enemy soldiers fell. The barbarian leaders whipped their troops from behind, pushing them forward. Many were forced into the sea and drowned, while others were trampled to death by their own comrades, with no concern for who died. Knowing they would eventually be killed by the forces coming around the mountain, the Greeks fought with all their might against the barbarians, showing great courage and desperation. 
224. By this point, most of the Greek soldiers had broken their spears and were fighting the Persians with swords. Leonidas, showing great bravery, died in that battle along with other well-known Spartans. I have learned their names through research, as they were honorable men. In fact, I have discovered the names of all three hundred Spartans. Many notable Persians also died there, including two sons of Darius, Abrocomes and Hyperanthes, who were born to Darius and Phratagune, the daughter of Artanes. Artanes was the brother of King Darius and the son of Hystaspes and Arsames. When he gave his daughter in marriage to Darius, he also provided his entire estate as a dowry, since she was his only child. 
225. Two of Xerxes' brothers also fought and died in the battle. There was a fierce fight between the Persians and the Spartans over Leonidas' body. The Greeks, with their bravery and skill, managed to pull the body away and push back their enemies four times. The battle continued until the forces led by Epialtes arrived. When the Greeks saw them, they retreated to the narrow part of the pass, went behind the wall, and gathered together on a hill, except for the Thebans. This hill is where the stone lion honoring Leonidas now stands. The Greeks defended themselves with swords, if they still had them, and with their hands and teeth. The enemy forces attacked them with missiles, some from the front, breaking down the defensive wall, while others surrounded them from all sides. 
226. The Spartans and Thespians fought bravely, but it is said that a Spartan named Dieneces showed the greatest courage of all. Before the battle with the Persians, he heard from a local that there were so many enemy soldiers that their arrows would block out the sun. Dieneces was not bothered by this and made light of the Persian army's size, saying that the local had brought good news. If the Persians blocked the sun with their arrows, they could fight in the shade instead of the sunlight. It is claimed that Dieneces left behind this saying and others like it as a lasting memory. 
227. Following Dieneces, two Spartan brothers, Alpheus and Maron, sons of Orsiphantus, were also said to have shown great bravery. Among the Thespians, the most renowned fighter was a man named Dithyrambus, son of Harmatides. 
228. There is an inscription for the men who were buried where they fell, and for those who died before Leonidas dismissed the others. It says, "Here four thousand from the Peloponnese once fought three million." This inscription is for all of them, but the Spartans have their own: "Foreigner, go tell the Spartans that we lie here obedient to their commands." The Lacedaemonians have this one, and the seer has another: "This is a monument to the renowned Megistias, slain by the Persians who crossed the Spercheius river. The seer knew well his coming doom, but endured not to abandon the leaders of Sparta." The Amphictyons honored them by putting up inscriptions and pillars, except for the seer's inscription, which was written by Simonides, son of Leoprepes, because of his friendship with Megistias. 
229. It is said that two of the three hundred Spartans, Eurytus and Aristodemus, had a choice to either return home safely together to Sparta, since Leonidas had dismissed them from the camp due to their severe eye infections, or to stay and die with the others if they didn't want to go back. They could have chosen either option, but they couldn't agree and had different plans. When Eurytus found out about the Persians' attack, he asked for his armor and put it on, telling his servant to lead him to the battle. The servant took him there and then ran away, while Eurytus joined the fight and was killed. Aristodemus, however, lost his strength and stayed behind. If only Aristodemus had been sick and returned to Sparta, or if both of them had gone back, the Spartans probably wouldn't have been angry with them. But when one of them died and the other had the same excuse but didn't want to die, the Spartans had no choice but to be very angry with Aristodemus. 
230. Some people believe that Aristodemus returned to Sparta safely using this reason as his excuse. Others say that he had been sent out of the camp as a messenger and could have made it back in time for the battle, but he chose not to. Instead, he stayed behind on the road and survived, while the other messenger who was with him reached the battle and was killed. 
231. When Aristodemus returned to Lacedaemon, he was dishonored and shamed. He lost his honor because no Spartan would share fire with him or talk to him, and they mocked him by calling him "Aristodemus the Trembler." However, during the battle at Plataea, he redeemed himself and made up for all the accusations against him. 
232. It is said that another one of the three hundred Spartans survived because he was sent on a mission to Thessaly. His name was Pantites. When he returned to Sparta, he was shamed and, unable to bear the disgrace, he hanged himself. 
233. The Thebans, led by their general Leontiades, fought against the king's army as long as they were with the Greeks and forced to do so. However, when they saw the Persian side winning and the Greeks with Leonidas rushing towards the hill, they separated and approached the Persians, raising their hands. They spoke the truth, saying that they supported the Persians, had been among the first to submit to the king, were forced to come to Thermopylae, and were not responsible for the harm done to the king. By making this plea, they saved their lives, and the Thessalians supported their claims. However, they were not entirely fortunate. When the Persians took hold of them as they approached, some of them were killed. Most of them were marked by Xerxes' command with the king's symbols, starting with the general Leontiades. His son Eurymachus was later killed by the Plataeans when, as the leader of four hundred Thebans, he captured the town of Plataea. 
234. This is how the Greeks fought at Thermopylae. Xerxes then called for Demaratus and asked him, saying, "Demaratus, you are a good man. I believe that because everything happened just as you predicted. Now, tell me this: how many Lacedaemonians are left, and how many of them are warriors like these? Or are they all like this?" "My king," said Demaratus, "there are many Lacedaemonians, and they have many cities. But I'll tell you what you want to know: there is a city in Lacedaemon called Sparta, a city with about eight thousand men, all of them as strong as those who fought here; the rest of the Lacedaemonians are not as strong as these, but they are still brave men." "And how, Demaratus," replied Xerxes, "can we defeat those men with the least trouble for ourselves? Please, tell me that, because you were their king and know their plans and strategies." 
235. "My king," Demaratus replied, "if you truly want my advice, I believe it's right for me to show you the best way. You should send three hundred ships from your fleet to the Laconian land. There's an island off their coast called Cythera. Chilon, a wise man among us, said that it would be better for the Spartans if Cythera were underwater rather than above it. He said this because he thought it would provide an opportunity for attack, just like I'm suggesting—not because he knew about your forces, but because he feared all potential enemies. So, let your ships station at that island and launch attacks from there to scare the Lacedaemonians. If they have to fight a war on their own borders, you won't have to worry about them sending troops to save the rest of Greece from your invasion; also, if the rest of Greece is enslaved, Laconia will be weakened if left alone. However, if you don't do this, expect what I'm about to tell you: a narrow strip of land leads to the Peloponnese; all the Peloponnesians will join forces there against you, and you can expect even tougher battles than the ones you've already fought. But if you follow my advice, you can capture that strip of land and all their cities without any fighting." 
236. Next, Achaemenes, Xerxes' brother and fleet admiral, who happened to be present during their conversation, spoke up. He was worried that Xerxes would be convinced to follow Demaratus' advice. "O king," he said, "I see that you are listening to a man who is either jealous of your success or possibly even a traitor to your cause. These are the traits that all Greeks share: they are envious of success and despise power. If you send away three hundred more ships from your fleet to sail around the Peloponnese after the recent disaster that destroyed four hundred of your ships, your enemies will have enough strength to fight you. However, if your fleet remains united, it will be unbeatable, and your enemies won't have enough forces to fight. Also, your entire navy will support your army, and your army will support your navy, both moving together. If you separate some of your fleet from yourself, you won't be able to help them, nor will they be able to help you. Instead, my advice is to focus on your own plans and not worry about your opponents' actions, where they will choose to fight, what they will do, or how many they are. They can think for themselves, and we can do the same for ourselves. As for the Lacedaemonians, if they face the Persians in battle, they won't be able to make up for their recent losses." 
237. "Achaemenes," Xerxes replied, "I think you speak well, and I will follow your advice. Even though your suggestion is better than his, I believe Demaratus is trying to be helpful to me, and I will never think that he is not on my side. I trust him because of everything he has said so far and because it's true that when one citizen succeeds, another becomes jealous and shows their dislike through silence. Rarely will someone give their best advice to a fellow citizen, unless they have reached the peak of excellence, which is quite rare. However, when a stranger succeeds, another stranger is more likely to be supportive and, if asked, will share their best advice. That's why I ask all of you not to speak ill of Demaratus, as he is a foreigner and a friend." 
238. After speaking like this, Xerxes went to the place where the dead bodies were and, upon learning that Leonidas had been the king and general of the Lacedaemonians, ordered his head to be cut off and impaled. This act, among many others, makes it clear to me that while Leonidas was alive, King Xerxes was angrier with him than with anyone else. Otherwise, he would not have treated Leonidas' dead body so brutally, as the Persians are known to honor brave warriors more than anyone else. Those who received these orders carried them out as I have mentioned. 
239. Now, I'll return to the part of the story where I left off earlier. The Lacedaemonians were the first to learn that the king was preparing to attack Greece. With this knowledge, they went to the oracle at Delphi and received the response I mentioned earlier. The way they found out about the king's plans was quite unusual. Demaratus, the son of Ariston, was an exile living among the Medes and, as I assume (with reason supporting me), was not a friend to the Lacedaemonians. It's unclear whether his actions were driven by goodwill or spiteful triumph. When Xerxes decided to march against Greece, Demaratus, who was in Susa at the time and aware of the plan, wanted to inform the Lacedaemonians. However, he was afraid of being caught and came up with a clever trick to send the message. He took a double tablet, scraped off the wax, and wrote the king's plan on the wood. Then, he melted the wax back over the writing so that the messenger carrying the seemingly blank tablet wouldn't be stopped by guards.  When the tablet arrived in Lacedaemon, the Lacedaemonians couldn't figure out its meaning. Eventually, as I've been told, Gorgo, Cleomenes' daughter and Leonidas' wife, discovered the trick herself and suggested they scrape off the wax to find the writing on the wood. When they did this, they found and read the message, and then shared it with the rest of the Greeks. This is the story as it has been told.
