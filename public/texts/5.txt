1. The Persians, led by Megabazus and left in Europe by Darius, conquered the Perinthians when they refused to submit to Darius' rule. The Perinthians had already faced trouble with the Paeonians due to a divine prophecy. The prophecy instructed the Paeonians to attack Perinthus if the Perinthians called out their name. If not, they were not to attack. The Paeonians followed these instructions. When the Perinthians set up camp outside their city, both armies decided to have a three-part duel, with individual men, horses, and dogs fighting each other. The Perinthians won two of the battles and, in their excitement, shouted "Paean." The Paeonians believed this fulfilled the prophecy and decided it was time to act. They attacked the Perinthians and won a significant victory, leaving only a few of their enemies alive. 
2. The Perinthians had already faced difficulties with the Paeonians in the past. Now, they bravely fought for their freedom against Megabazus and the Persians. However, the Persians defeated them due to their larger army. After capturing Perinthus, Megabazus led his forces through Thrace, conquering every city and group of people in the area. This was his mission from Darius. 
3. The Thracians are the second largest group of people in the world, after the Indians. If they were united under one leader, they would likely be unbeatable and the most powerful nation. However, since there is no way to achieve this unity, they remain weak. There are many different tribes within the Thracian population, each with its own name based on their location. Despite this, their customs are mostly similar, except for the Getae, the Trausi, and those living above the Crestonaeans. 
4. I have previously described the practices of the Getae, who believe they are immortal. The Trausi, another Thracian tribe, follow similar customs to other Thracians, except for their rituals surrounding birth and death. When a child is born, the family gathers and mourns the hardships the child will face throughout life, listing all the possible sorrows. However, when someone dies, they celebrate with joy, believing that the person has been freed from all their troubles and has reached a state of total happiness. 
5. The people living above the Crestonaeans have different customs. Each man has multiple wives, and when he dies, there is a strong competition among the wives and their friends to determine which wife was the most loved by her husband. The wife who is chosen as the most loved receives praise from both men and women. Then, her closest relative kills her, and she is buried alongside her husband. The other wives feel upset and dishonored by this outcome. 
6. In other Thracian communities, they have a tradition of selling their children for export and not protecting their young women, allowing them to be with any man they choose. However, they carefully guard their wives and pay a price to the parents for them. Having tattoos indicates nobility, while not having them is a sign of lower status. People who don't work are highly respected, while farmers are looked down upon. Those who live by fighting and stealing are considered the most honorable. 
7. These are some of their most significant customs. They mainly worship three gods: Ares, Dionysus, and Artemis. However, their leaders, unlike the rest of the people, highly honor Hermes above all other gods and only swear by him, considering him to be their ancestor. 
8. The rich follow these funeral customs. First, they display the deceased for three days, during which they sacrifice various animals, mourn, and have a feast. Afterward, they either cremate or bury the body, and once they have built a burial mound, they organize various competitions. The most valuable prizes are given for the toughest one-on-one battles. These are the Thracian funeral traditions. 
9. The area north of this country is not well-known, and beyond the Ister River lies a vast, desolate land. The only people I've heard of living there are the Sigynnae, who wear clothing similar to the Medians. They have small horses with thick, shaggy hair, which are not suitable for riding but are very fast when pulling chariots. This is why chariot racing is popular in their culture. It is said that their territory stretches almost to the Eneti near the Adriatic Sea, and they claim to be descendants of the Medians. I'm not sure how this is possible, but anything can happen over time. Interestingly, the Ligyes people living near Massalia use the term "sigynnae" for traders, while the Cyprians use it for spears. 
10. The Thracians believe that the land beyond the Ister River is filled with bees, making it impossible for anyone to travel there. However, I find this hard to believe, as bees cannot tolerate cold weather. It seems more likely that the cold climate is the reason why the northern lands are uninhabited. Regardless of the actual reason, Megabazus managed to conquer the coastal area and bring it under Persian control. 
11. When Darius crossed the Hellespont and arrived in Sardis, he remembered the valuable help he received from Histiaeus of Miletus and the advice of Coes the Mytilenaean. He summoned them to Sardis and offered them whatever they desired. Histiaeus, already being the ruler of Miletus, didn't ask for more power but requested Myrcinus in the Edonian land to build a city there. That was Histiaeus' choice. On the other hand, Coes, who was an ordinary citizen, asked to be made the ruler of Mytilene. 
12. After their wishes were granted, they went to their chosen places. Meanwhile, Darius saw something that made him decide to order Megabazus to move the Paeonians from their homes in Europe to Asia. Two Paeonian men, Pigres and Mantyes, wanted to become rulers of their people. When Darius crossed into Asia, they came to Sardis with their tall and beautiful sister. They waited until Darius was seated in the Lydian city's suburb, then dressed their sister in fine clothes and sent her to fetch water with a vessel on her head, leading a horse by the bridle, and spinning flax at the same time. Darius noticed the woman because her actions were unlike those of Persians, Lydians, or any other Asian people. He sent his guards to watch what she would do with the horse. They followed her to the river, where she watered the horse and filled her vessel. Then she returned the same way, carrying the water on her head, leading the horse, and spinning the flax. 
13. Darius was amazed by what his guards reported and what he saw himself. He asked the woman to be brought before him, and her brothers, who were watching nearby, came along as well. Darius asked about her nationality, and the young men told him they were Paeonians and she was their sister. Darius then asked, "Who are the Paeonians, where do they live, and why have you come to Sardis?" They explained that they wanted to serve him, that Paeonia's towns were located near the Strymon River, not far from the Hellespont, and that they were descendants of the Teucrians of Troy. Darius then asked if all the women in their country were as hardworking as their sister. The brothers eagerly replied that it was true, as this was the very reason they had come to Sardis. 
14. Darius then wrote a letter to Megabazus, his general in Thrace, instructing him to bring the Paeonians to him, including men, women, and children. A messenger quickly delivered the letter to the Hellespont, and after crossing it, handed it to Megabazus. Upon reading the letter, Megabazus took guides from Thrace and led his army to Paeonia. 
15. When the Paeonians heard that the Persians were coming, they gathered their forces and went to the sea, believing that the Persians would attack from there. They prepared to defend against Megabazus' army, but the Persians, learning that the Paeonians were guarding the coastal route, took guides and marched through the highlands instead. This caught the Paeonians off guard, and the Persians easily entered their cities, which were left undefended. Upon realizing that their towns had been captured, the Paeonians disbanded their forces and surrendered to the Persians. As a result, the Siriopaeones, Paeoplae, and all Paeonians living up to the Prasiad lake were taken from their homes and brought to Asia. 
16. However, Megabazus never managed to conquer the people living near the Pangaean mountains, the Doberes, Agrianes, Odomanti, and around the Prasiad lake. He did try to capture the lake-dwellers using a particular strategy. In the middle of the lake, there was a platform built on tall piles, connected to the land by a narrow bridge. In the past, all the people worked together to set up the supporting piles, but later they developed a new method. Men would bring piles from a mountain called Orbelus, and each man would plant three piles for each of the three women he married. Each man had a hut on the platform and a trap-door leading down into the lake. They tied cords to their children's feet to prevent them from falling into the water. They fed their horses and other animals with fish, which were abundant in the lake. A man could simply open his trap-door, lower an empty basket into the lake, and quickly pull it up full of fish. There were two types of fish: "paprakes" and "tilones." 
17. The captured Paeonians were taken to Asia. After capturing them, Megabazus sent seven of the most honorable Persians in his army, besides himself, as messengers to Macedonia. They were sent to Amyntas to request earth and water for King Darius. There is a direct route from the Prasiad lake to Macedonia. Near the lake, there is a mine from which Alexander later extracted a daily revenue of a talent of silver. Once a person passes the mine, they only need to cross the mountain called Dysorum to reach Macedonia. 
18. The Persian envoys went to Amyntas and asked for earth and water on behalf of King Darius. Amyntas agreed and invited them to a lavish dinner as his guests. After dinner, while they were drinking together, the Persians told Amyntas that in Persia, it was customary for men to be joined by their wives and concubines after a grand feast. They asked Amyntas to follow their custom since he had welcomed them warmly and agreed to give earth and water to King Darius. Amyntas replied that they didn't have such a custom in Macedonia, where men and women sat separately. However, since the Persians were their masters and had made the request, he agreed to do as they wished. He then called for the women, who came and sat in a row opposite the Persians. Seeing the beautiful women, the Persians told Amyntas that it made no sense for the women to be present but not sit beside the men, as it only tormented their eyes. Feeling obliged, Amyntas asked the women to sit next to the Persians. Once the women were seated beside them, the Persians, who were already drunk, began touching the women's breasts and attempting to kiss them. 
19. Amyntas saw what was happening but remained silent despite his anger, as he was afraid of the Persians. However, his son Alexander, being young and unaccustomed to such behavior, couldn't bear it any longer. In a fit of rage, he told his father, "My father, please do what is appropriate for your age. Leave us and get some rest; don't keep drinking. I will stay here and take care of our guests." Amyntas realized that Alexander was planning something reckless and said, "My son, I can see that you are angry and want me to leave so you can do something violent. I'm worried that you might cause trouble for us, so I beg you not to act rashly against these men and to be patient with their actions. If you want me to leave, I will agree to that." 
20. When Amyntas left, Alexander told the Persians, "Gentlemen, you have the freedom to interact with these women as you wish. You can decide whether to be with all or any of them. But since it's getting late and you all seem very drunk, let the women leave and freshen up if you'd like. They will return to you after they've washed." After the Persians agreed, Alexander sent the women away to their rooms. He then gathered an equal number of young, beardless men, dressed them in the women's clothes, and gave them daggers. He brought them in and told the Persians, "I believe you've enjoyed the feast to your heart's content. We've provided everything we had and more. Now, we offer you our most precious gift: our own mothers and sisters. By doing this, we're showing you the utmost respect. Please tell your king how his Greek viceroy of Macedonia has treated you with great hospitality, providing food and companions." Alexander then seated each Macedonian next to a Persian, pretending they were women. When the Persians started touching them, the Macedonians killed them. 
21. The Persians and their entire entourage met their end in this manner. They had arrived with carriages, servants, and a large group of followers. The Macedonians eliminated all of them, including the envoys themselves. Later, the Persians conducted a thorough search for the missing men, but Alexander cleverly put a stop to it by offering a large sum of money and his own sister Gygaea in marriage to Bubares, a Persian general who was leading the search for the deceased men. This is how the deaths of the Persians were kept a secret. 
22. The descendants of Perdiccas claim to be Greeks, which I happen to know and will prove later in my history. Moreover, the Hellenodicae, who oversee the Olympic Games, confirmed this. When Alexander wanted to participate in the games, the Greek competitors tried to prevent him from entering, arguing that the competition was for Greeks only, not foreigners. However, Alexander proved that he was from Argos, and thus, was considered a Greek. As a result, he competed in the race and tied for first place. This is roughly what occurred. 
23. Megabazus, along with the Paeonians, arrived at the Hellespont and crossed it to reach Sardis. By this time, Histiaeus of Miletus was fortifying a place called Myrcinus by the river Strymon, which he had requested from Darius as a reward for guarding the bridge. When Megabazus found out about this, he spoke to Darius upon arriving at Sardis with the Paeonians, "Sire, what have you allowed? You've let a clever and cunning Greek build a city in Thrace, where there are plenty of resources for shipbuilding, wood for oars, silver mines, and many people, both Greek and foreign, living nearby. These people, if led by a strong leader, will follow his orders day and night. Prevent this man from continuing his actions, so you won't have to deal with a rebellion among your own subjects. Use gentle methods to stop him, and once you have him under control, make sure he never returns to Hellas." 
24. Darius was easily convinced by Megabazus, believing that his foresight was accurate. The king then sent a message to Myrcinus, saying, "Histiaeus, this is what King Darius says: I cannot think of anyone more loyal and dedicated to me and my interests. Your actions have proven this to me. So, don't hesitate to come to me, as I want to share some important plans I have in mind." Trusting these words and feeling proud that he would be the king's advisor, Histiaeus went to Sardis. Upon his arrival, Darius told him, "Histiaeus, I'll tell you why I called for you. After returning from Scythia and being apart from you, all I wanted was to see you and talk to you, because I know that a wise and loyal friend is the most valuable thing one can have. I can vouch for your loyalty in my affairs. Now, since you've come here, I have a proposal for you. Leave Miletus and your newly established city in Thrace, and join me in Susa. There, you'll have access to everything I have, sharing my table and my advice." 
25. Darius spoke these words, and before leaving for Susa with Histiaeus, he appointed Artaphrenes, his half-brother, as the governor of Sardis. He also made Otanes the ruler of the coastal people. Otanes' father, Sisamnes, had been a royal judge. Cambyses had executed him by cutting his throat and skinning him for accepting a bribe and giving an unjust verdict. Cambyses then used strips of Sisamnes' skin to cover the seat where he had given judgments. After doing this, Cambyses appointed Otanes, the son of the executed and skinned Sisamnes, as the new judge, reminding him to always remember the nature of the seat he was sitting on. 
26. Otanes, who had taken the seat of his father, was appointed as Megabazus' successor as governor. He conquered Byzantium, Calchedon, Antandrus in the Troad, and Lamponium. Using ships captured from the Lesbians, he also seized Lemnos and Imbros, both of which were still inhabited by Pelasgians. 
27. The people of Lemnos fought bravely and defended themselves until they were in a difficult situation. The Persians then appointed Lycaretus, the brother of Maeandrius, the former king of Samos, as the governor of the remaining Lemnians. However, Lycaretus met his end while ruling in Lemnos because he attempted to enslave and control the entire population. He accused some of avoiding service against the Scythians and others of looting Darius' army when they returned from Scythia. 
28. Otanes accomplished all of this after becoming governor. However, after a brief period of peace, problems arose again for the Ionians, originating from Naxos and Miletus. Naxos was the most prosperous of all the islands, while Miletus, at the peak of its success, was the pride of Ionia. Two generations earlier, Miletus had faced significant turmoil due to internal conflicts. The Parians, selected by the Milesians from all the Greeks, eventually helped restore peace among them. 
29. The Parians resolved the conflict in Miletus in the following way. Their most respected men visited Miletus and noticed that the households were in poor condition. They asked to explore the countryside, and as they traveled through the territory of Miletus, they took note of any well-maintained farms they found amidst the desolation. After covering the entire region and identifying only a few such farmers, they returned to the city and gathered the people. They appointed those farmers, whose lands were well-kept, as the rulers of the state. They believed that these individuals would manage public affairs as efficiently as they had managed their own properties. They also instructed the rest of the feuding Milesians to obey these newly appointed leaders. 
30. The Parians had previously brought peace to Miletus, but now trouble began to arise in Ionia due to conflicts between these cities. Some wealthy individuals, who had been exiled by the common people, sought refuge in Miletus. At that time, Aristagoras, the son of Molpagoras and son-in-law and cousin of Histiaeus, was in charge of Miletus. Histiaeus, the ruler of Miletus, was in Susa with Darius when the exiled Naxians, who were his friends and guests, arrived. The Naxians approached Aristagoras, asking for his help in regaining control of their homeland. Aristagoras saw an opportunity to become the ruler of Naxos if he could help them, and used his connection with Histiaeus as a reason to assist them. He explained that he didn't have the power to help them directly, as the Naxians had a strong army and many warships. However, he offered to do his best by seeking the support of Artaphrenes, a powerful friend who was the brother of King Darius and governor of the coastal regions of Asia. Artaphrenes had a large army and many ships at his disposal, and Aristagoras believed he would be willing to help. The Naxians agreed to let Aristagoras handle the situation and promised to cover the costs of the army and any gifts required. They were hopeful that their fellow Naxians would obey their commands once they arrived with support. They also expected the other islanders to follow suit, as none of the Cycladic islands were under Darius's control at that time. 
31. Aristagoras went to Sardis and spoke to Artaphrenes about Naxos. He described it as a small but beautiful and noble island close to Ionia, with an abundance of wealth and slaves. He suggested that Artaphrenes should send an army to help the exiled Naxians return to their homeland. In return, Aristagoras promised to provide a large sum of money to cover the expenses of the military campaign, as well as help expand the king's territory by conquering Naxos and its neighboring islands, such as Paros, Andros, and the rest of the Cyclades. From there, they could easily attack the large and wealthy island of Euboea, which was similar in size to Cyprus and easy to conquer. Aristagoras believed that a hundred ships would be enough to achieve this goal. Artaphrenes responded positively to the proposal, saying that it would benefit the king and that Aristagoras' advice was sound, except for the number of ships needed. He promised to provide not one hundred, but two hundred ships when spring arrived. However, he also mentioned that the king himself must approve the plan. 
32. Upon hearing Artaphrenes' response, Aristagoras returned to Miletus filled with happiness. Artaphrenes then sent a messenger to Susa to inform Darius about Aristagoras' proposal. Once Darius agreed to the plan, Artaphrenes prepared two hundred triremes and a large force of Persians and their allies. He appointed Megabates, a Persian from the Achaemenid family and cousin to both himself and Darius, as the general. Megabates was later rumored to be engaged to the daughter of Pausanias, a Lacedaemonian who desired to rule over Hellas. After assigning Megabates as the general, Artaphrenes sent the army to join Aristagoras. 
33. Megabates, along with Aristagoras, the Ionian army, and the Naxians, set sail towards the Hellespont. However, when they reached Chios, they stopped at Caucasa, planning to cross over to Naxos with a favorable north wind. But fate had other plans for the Naxians, and an unexpected incident occurred. While Megabates was inspecting the ships, he discovered that one of them, the ship of Myndus, had no watch on duty. Furious, he ordered his guards to find the ship's captain, Scylax, and tie him up with his head outside the ship and his body inside. When Aristagoras heard about Scylax's punishment, he went to Megabates to plead for his friend's release. However, Megabates refused to listen, so Aristagoras took matters into his own hands and freed Scylax himself. This angered Megabates even more, leading to a heated exchange between the two. Aristagoras argued that Megabates was sent by Artaphrenes to follow his orders and should not interfere in such matters. Frustrated by Aristagoras' words, Megabates secretly sent a message to the Naxians at night, warning them of the impending attack. 
34. The Naxians had no idea that they were the target of the approaching army. However, when they received the warning, they quickly moved everything from their fields into the city, stocked up on food and drink, and fortified their walls in preparation for war. As the enemy ships arrived from Chios and attacked Naxos, they found a well-prepared city. The Persians besieged the city for four months, but eventually ran out of money and resources. Aristagoras also spent a significant amount of his own funds during the siege. In the end, they built a stronghold for the exiled Naxians and returned to the mainland, disheartened and in need of more money to continue the siege. 
35. Aristagoras found himself unable to keep his promise to Artaphrenes and was burdened by the demands for money to cover the military expenses. He also worried about the consequences of the failed campaign and Megabates' anger towards him, fearing that he might lose his position as the ruler of Miletus. With these concerns in mind, he started considering rebellion. Coincidentally, at that time, a messenger arrived from Susa, sent by Histiaeus. Since Histiaeus wanted to secretly encourage Aristagoras to revolt but couldn't risk sending a message through normal channels due to the guarded roads, he came up with a clever plan. He shaved the head of his most trusted slave and branded the message onto his scalp. After the hair grew back, he sent the slave to Miletus with instructions for Aristagoras to shave his head and read the hidden message. The message, as mentioned earlier, was a call for rebellion. Histiaeus took this risky step because he was unhappy with his confinement in Susa and believed that if a revolt occurred, he would be sent back to the coast. However, if Miletus remained peaceful, he feared he would never return home. 
36. Histiaeus sent his messenger with the intention of encouraging revolt, and this message arrived at the same time as Aristagoras was considering rebellion. Aristagoras discussed the situation with his allies, sharing his thoughts and the message from Histiaeus. Most of them agreed with the idea of revolt, except for Hecataeus, the historian. He warned them against going to war with the powerful Persian king, Darius, by listing all the nations under his control. When Hecataeus couldn't convince them, he suggested an alternative plan: to gain control of the sea. He believed this could be achieved by taking the treasure that Croesus, the Lydian king, had dedicated to the temple at Branchidae. Hecataeus knew that Miletus wasn't a wealthy city, but with this treasure, they could potentially dominate the sea. This would also prevent their enemies from plundering the treasure, which was quite significant, as mentioned earlier in the story. However, this plan wasn't accepted either, and they decided to proceed with the revolt. As part of their plan, one of them was to sail to Myus, where the army that had left Naxos was stationed, and try to capture the generals on board the ships. 
37. Iatragoras was sent on this mission and cleverly captured several important figures, including Oliatus of Mylasa, Histiaeus of Termera, Coes of Mytilene, Aristagoras of Cyme, and many others. With these captures, Aristagoras openly began his revolt, seeking ways to harm Darius. First, he pretended to give up his rule and established an equal government in Miletus, hoping that the people would eagerly join his rebellion. He then did the same in other parts of Ionia. He banished some of the tyrants, while others, who had been captured from the ships during the Naxos campaign, were handed over to their respective cities as a gesture of goodwill. 
38. When Coes was handed over to the Mytilenaeans, they stoned him to death. However, the Cymaeans and most of the other cities released their captured tyrants. This marked the end of tyranny in those cities. After removing the tyrants, Aristagoras of Miletus instructed each city to establish their own governing body. Realizing the need for a powerful ally, Aristagoras then embarked on a diplomatic mission to Lacedaemon, traveling in a trireme. 
39. In Sparta, Anaxandrides, the son of Leon, was no longer alive, and his son Cleomenes had taken over the throne. Cleomenes became king not because of his abilities, but due to his birthright. Anaxandrides had married his niece, but they had no children together.  Seeing this, the Ephors approached Anaxandrides and said, "Even if you don't care about your own situation, we cannot let the house of Eurysthenes die out. You should send away your current wife, who hasn't given you any children, and marry someone else. This would please the Spartans." However, Anaxandrides replied that he wouldn't do either of those things and that their advice was not good, as his wife was not at fault and he had no reason to marry another woman. 
40. The Ephors and Elders discussed the situation and presented a new proposal to Anaxandrides: "We understand that you love your current wife, but please consider our request and don't resist it, as the Spartans may find another way to deal with this issue. You don't have to send your wife away. Continue to provide for her as you do now, but also marry another woman who can give you children." Anaxandrides agreed to their proposal. Soon, he had two wives and maintained two households, which was quite unusual in Sparta. 
41. In a short time, the second wife gave birth to Cleomenes, providing the Spartans with a royal heir. Coincidentally, the first wife, who had been unable to conceive before, became pregnant at the same time. When the second wife's friends found out, they started causing problems for the first wife. They claimed she was making false claims and planning to substitute a child. The Ephors were upset, and as the first wife's due date approached, they decided to watch her during childbirth because they were skeptical. She gave birth to Dorieus, followed immediately by Leonidas, and then Cleombrotus. Some people believe that Cleombrotus and Leonidas were twins. The second wife, who was the mother of Cleomenes and the daughter of Prinetadas, son of Demarmenus, did not have any more children. 
42. The story goes that Cleomenes was not mentally stable and quite mad, while Dorieus was the best among his peers and believed he would become king due to his worthiness. When their father Anaxandrides died, the Lacedaemonians followed tradition and made Cleomenes king based on his age. This made Dorieus very angry, and he couldn't stand being under Cleomenes' rule. Dorieus asked the Spartans for a group of people to join him as settlers. He didn't consult the oracle at Delphi about where to establish his settlement, nor did he follow any other customs. Instead, he left for Libya in a fit of anger, guided by men from Thera. Upon arriving, he settled near the Cinyps river in the most beautiful part of Libya. However, in the third year, he was forced to leave by the Macae, Libyans, and Carchedonians, and he returned to the Peloponnesus. 
43. A man named Antichares from Eleon advised Dorieus, based on the oracles of Laius, to establish a colony at Heraclea in Sicily. Antichares explained that Heracles himself had conquered the entire region of Eryx, so it rightfully belonged to his descendants. Hearing this, Dorieus went to Delphi to ask the oracle if he should take control of the place he planned to go. The priestess confirmed that he should, so Dorieus took the group he had brought to Libya and headed to Italy. 
44. According to the Sybarites, during this time, they and their king Telys were preparing to attack Croton. The people of Croton, who were very scared, asked Dorieus for help. Dorieus agreed and joined them in their fight against Sybaris, eventually capturing the city. This is the story told by the Sybarites about Dorieus and his companions. However, the Crotoniats have a different version. They claim that no outsider helped them in their war against Sybaris, except for Callias, an Elean diviner from the Iamid clan. There was a story about Callias that he had fled to Croton from Telys, the tyrant of Sybaris, because he couldn't get any favorable omens while performing a sacrifice for victory over Croton. 
45. Both cities have evidence to support their stories. The Sybarites point to a sacred area and a temple near the dry bed of the Crathis river, which they claim Dorieus built in honor of Athena of Crathis after helping them capture their city. They believe that Dorieus' death is their strongest proof, as he died because he did more than the oracle instructed. If he had only done what he set out to do, he would have conquered and held the Erycine region without causing his own death and the loss of his army. On the other hand, the Crotoniats show many pieces of land that were given to Callias of Elis, where his descendants still lived during the time of the story. However, they don't have any land or gifts for Dorieus and his descendants. They argue that if Dorieus had helped them in their war against Sybaris, he would have received a much greater reward than what was given to Callias. So, both sides present their evidence, and people can choose to believe whichever story they find more convincing. 
46. Dorieus was joined by other Spartans, including Thessalus, Paraebates, Celees, and Euryleon, in his quest to establish a colony. When they arrived in Sicily with their followers, they were defeated and killed in battle by the Phoenicians and Egestans. The only survivor was Euryleon, who managed to gather the remaining forces and capture Minoa, a colony from Selinus. He also helped free the people of Selinus from their ruler, Pithagoras. After overthrowing Pithagoras, Euryleon tried to become the tyrant of Selinus himself. However, his reign was short-lived, as the local people rebelled against him. They killed him at the altar of Zeus in the marketplace, where he had sought refuge. 
47. Philippus of Croton, the son of Butacides, was one of those who joined Dorieus and died alongside him. He had been engaged to the daughter of Telys of Sybaris but was exiled from Croton. Feeling cheated out of his marriage, he traveled to Cyrene and then decided to follow Dorieus. He provided his own trireme, a type of ship, and paid for all the expenses of his crew. Philippus was an Olympic champion and considered the most handsome Greek of his time. In recognition of his physical beauty, the Egestans honored him in a unique way. They built a hero's shrine near his grave and performed propitiatory sacrifices in his memory. 
48. Dorieus met his end in this way. If he had accepted Cleomenes' rule and remained in Sparta, he would have become the king of Lacedaemon. This is because Cleomenes' reign was not very long, and he left behind only one child, a daughter named Gorgo. 
49. During Cleomenes' reign, Aristagoras, the ruler of Miletus, visited Sparta. The Lacedaemonians say that he brought with him a bronze tablet with a map of the entire world, including all the seas and rivers. When he met with Cleomenes, Aristagoras said, "Don't be surprised by my eagerness to come here. Our current situation is that the Ionians are slaves, not free men. This is shameful and painful for us and for you, as the leaders of Greece. We ask you, by the gods of Greece, to save your Ionian relatives from slavery. You can easily do this because you are brave warriors, while our enemies are not. They fight with bows and short spears, wearing trousers and turbans, making them easy to defeat. Moreover, they have more wealth than anyone else, including gold, silver, bronze, colorful cloth, animals, and slaves. You can have all of this if you want. "I will show you how their lands are connected. Next to the Ionians are the Lydians, who live in a fertile land with lots of silver," Aristagoras said, pointing to the map on the tablet. "Next to the Lydians are the Phrygians to the east, who are the richest in livestock and crops. Then come the Cappadocians, whom we call Syrians, and their neighbors, the Cilicians, whose land reaches the sea where the island of Cyprus lies. They pay a yearly tribute of 500 talents to the king. Next to the Cilicians are the Armenians, who are also rich in livestock, followed by the Matieni and the Cissians. In the Cissian land, you can find the city of Susa on the Choaspes River, where the great king lives and keeps his wealth. Capture that city, and you'll be richer than Zeus himself. "So, why fight for small pieces of land against the Messenians, Arcadians, and Argives, who have no gold or silver? Instead, you can easily conquer all of Asia. Will you refuse this opportunity?" Aristagoras asked. Cleomenes replied, "Milesian guest, wait for my answer on the third day." 
50. At that time, they had reached this point in their discussion. When they met again on the agreed-upon day for Cleomenes' answer, he asked Aristagoras how many days it would take to travel from the Ionian Sea to the king's residence. Until then, Aristagoras had been clever and had successfully deceived the Spartan. However, he made a mistake at this point. If he wanted to convince the Spartans to go to Asia, he should not have told the truth. But he did, and said it was a three-month journey inland. Upon hearing this, Cleomenes interrupted Aristagoras and told him to leave Sparta before sunset. He said the Lacedaemonians would never agree to the plan if it meant being led on a three-month journey away from the sea. 
51. After their conversation, Cleomenes returned to his home, but Aristagoras, dressed as a suppliant, followed him there. Once inside, he begged Cleomenes to listen to him. He first asked Cleomenes to send away his daughter, Gorgo, who was standing nearby. She was his only child, about eight or nine years old. Cleomenes told him to speak freely and not worry about the child's presence. Aristagoras then started offering Cleomenes increasing amounts of money, starting from ten talents, if he would agree to his request. When Cleomenes refused, Aristagoras kept raising the offer. Finally, when he promised fifty talents, the child shouted, "Father, the stranger will corrupt you if you don't leave him and go away." Cleomenes was pleased with his daughter's advice and went to another room, while Aristagoras left Sparta without any further opportunity to discuss the journey to the king's palace. 
52. The road I'm describing has the following features: it has the king's rest stations and excellent resting places all along it, and it passes through inhabited and safe areas. It goes through Lydia and Phrygia for twenty stages and ninety-four and a half parasangs. Then it reaches the Halys River, where there's a narrow passage that must be crossed and a large fortress to protect it. After crossing into Cappadocia, the road continues for twenty-eight stages and one hundred and four parasangs until it reaches the border of Cilicia. Here, you must pass through two narrow passages and two fortresses. Once you've passed these, you'll travel through Cilicia for three stages and fifteen and a half parasangs. The border between Cilicia and Armenia is marked by the Euphrates River, which can be navigated. In Armenia, there are fifteen rest stops and fifty-six and a half parasangs, as well as a fortress. From Armenia, the road enters the Matienian territory, where there are thirty-four stages and one hundred and thirty-seven parasangs. Four navigable rivers must be crossed by ferries in this region: first the Tigris, then two more rivers with the same name but different sources, and finally the Gyndes River, which Cyrus once divided into three hundred and sixty channels. After passing through this region, the road enters the Cissian territory, where there are eleven stages and forty-two and a half parasangs until you reach another navigable river, the Choaspes. The city of Susa is located on its banks. 
53. In total, there are 111 rest stops on the journey from Sardis to Susa. If my calculations of the royal road's parasangs are correct, and each parasang is indeed thirty furlongs long, then the distance between Sardis and the king's residence, known as Memnonian, is 13,500 furlongs, which equals 450 parasangs. If you travel 150 furlongs per day, the journey will take exactly 90 days, no more and no less. 
54. Aristagoras of Miletus was right when he told Cleomenes the Lacedaemonian that the journey inland took about three months. For those who want a more precise measurement, I can provide that as well. We need to add the distance from Ephesus to Sardis to the total. So, the journey from the Greek sea to Susa, also known as Memnonian, is 14,040 stages, since there are 540 furlongs between Ephesus and Sardis. Therefore, the three-month journey is actually extended by three days. 
55. When Aristagoras had to leave Sparta, he went to Athens, which had recently been liberated from its oppressive rulers in the following way. Hipparchus, the son of Pisistratus and brother of the tyrant Hippias, was killed by Aristogiton and Harmodius, who were of Gephyraean origin. Hipparchus had actually received a warning about this in a dream. After his death, the Athenians endured four more years of tyranny, which was even more severe than before. 
56. Hipparchus had a vision in a dream the night before the Panathenaea festival. In the dream, a tall and handsome man stood over him and spoke these mysterious words: "O lion, bear the unbearable with a lion's heart. No one on earth can do wrong without facing the consequences." When morning came, Hipparchus shared his dream with those who interpreted dreams. However, he soon put the vision out of his mind and led the procession where he ultimately met his death. 
57. The Gephyraean clan, to which the killers of Hipparchus belonged, claimed to have originally come from Eretria. However, my research indicates that they were actually part of the Phoenicians who arrived with Cadmus in the region now known as Boeotia. In that area, they settled in the lands of Tanagra, which were assigned to them. The Cadmeans were first driven out of there by the Argives, and later, the Gephyraeans were forced to leave by the Boeotians. The Athenians welcomed them as citizens but set certain conditions, excluding them from several activities that are not worth mentioning here. 
58. The Phoenicians, who arrived with Cadmus and included the Gephyraeans, introduced the alphabet to Greece, along with many other types of knowledge. The Greeks, who were mostly Ionians living nearby, had not known the alphabet before. Over time, the sounds and shapes of the letters evolved. After learning the alphabet from the Phoenicians, the Ionians made a few changes to the letter forms and named them "Phoenician," which was appropriate since the Phoenicians had brought them to Greece. Since ancient times, the Ionians have referred to sheets of papyrus as "skins" because they used to write on sheep and goat skins before papyrus was available. Even today, many people from other countries still write on animal skins. 
59. I have personally seen Cadmean writing in the temple of Ismenian Apollo in Thebes of Boeotia, engraved on some tripods. Most of the writing looked similar to Ionian letters. One of the tripods had the following inscription: "Amphitryon dedicated me from the spoils of Teleboae." This inscription likely dates back to the time of Laius, who was the son of Labdacus, the grandson of Polydorus, and the great-grandson of Cadmus. 
60. Another tripod has the following inscription in a six-beat poetic rhythm: "Scaeus the boxer, winning the competition, gave me to Apollo, the god of archery, as a beautiful gift." If this Scaeus is indeed the son of Hippocoon, and not someone else with the same name, he would have lived during the time of Oedipus, the son of Laius. 
61. The third tripod has another inscription in a six-beat poetic rhythm: "Laodamas, during his reign, dedicated this cauldron to Apollo, the accurate archer, as a beautiful gift." While Laodamas, the son of Eteocles, ruled, the Cadmeans were forced out by the Argives and moved to the Encheleis. The Gephyraeans remained but were later made to leave by the Boeotians and went to Athens. In Athens, they have unique religious practices that other Athenians don't participate in, especially the rituals and mysteries related to Achaean Demeter. 
62. I have already discussed Hipparchus' dream and the origins of the Gephyreans, to which the killers of Hipparchus belonged. Now, I will return to the story of how the Athenians gained freedom from their tyrants. Hippias, the tyrant, became increasingly hostile towards the Athenians due to Hipparchus' death. The Alcmeonidae, an Athenian family exiled by the sons of Pisistratus, tried to return to Athens with other exiles to free the city. However, their attempt failed, and they faced a significant setback. After fortifying Lipsydrium, located north of Paeonia, they decided to use every possible strategy against the sons of Pisistratus. They took a job from the Amphictyons to build the temple at Delphi, which did not exist at that time. Being wealthy and reputable like their ancestors, they made the temple even more beautiful than the original design. Specifically, they agreed to build the temple using tufa, but they used Parian marble for the front instead. 
63. According to the Athenians, these men settled in Delphi and bribed the Pythian priestess to tell any visiting Spartans, whether for private or public matters, to free Athens. As a result, the Lacedaemonians, despite their close friendship with the Pisistratidae, sent a reputable citizen named Anchimolius, the son of Aster, with an army to drive out the sons of Pisistratus. They prioritized the god's will over human desires and sent their forces by sea. Anchimolius and his army arrived at Phalerum, but the sons of Pisistratus had already learned about the plan and asked for help from their allies, the Thessalians. In response, the Thessalians sent their king, Cineas of Conium, along with a thousand horsemen. With these new allies, the Pisistratidae devised a strategy. They destroyed the plain of Phalerum to make it suitable for horse riding and then launched their cavalry against the enemy. The horsemen attacked, killing Anchimolius and many Lacedaemonians, and forcing the survivors to retreat to their ships. The first Lacedaemonian army withdrew, and Anchimolius' tomb can be found in Alopecae in Attica, near the Heracleum in Cynosarges. 
64. After this, the Lacedaemonians sent a larger army to attack Athens, led by their king Cleomenes, the son of Anaxandrides. Instead of going by sea, they sent this army by land. As they entered Attica, they first encountered the Thessalian horsemen. The battle was brief, and more than forty men were killed. The surviving Thessalians quickly retreated to Thessaly. Cleomenes, along with the Athenians who sought freedom, entered the city and forced the tyrants' family into the Pelasgic wall, where they were besieged. 
65. The Lacedaemonians would not have been able to capture the Pisistratid stronghold. Firstly, they had no intention of blockading it, and secondly, the Pisistratidae were well-supplied with food and drink. The Lacedaemonians would have only besieged the place for a few days before returning to Sparta. However, fortune took a turn, harming one side and helping the other, as the sons of the Pisistratid family were caught while being secretly smuggled out of the country. This event disrupted all their plans, and they agreed to leave Attica within five days, accepting the terms set by the Athenians in exchange for the safe return of their children. They then went to Sigeum on the Scamander River. The Pisistratidae had ruled the Athenians for thirty-six years and were descendants of the house of Pylos and Neleus, sharing the same ancestry as the families of Codrus and Melanthus, who had previously come from abroad to become kings of Athens. This is why Hippocrates named his son Pisistratus, in memory of Pisistratus, the son of Nestor. This is how the Athenians got rid of their tyrants. As for the significant events that took place or were endured by the Athenians after gaining their freedom and before Ionia revolted against Darius and Aristagoras of Miletus came to Athens seeking help, I will provide an account of these events first. 
66. Athens, which was already a great city, grew even greater after the removal of its tyrants. The two main leaders were Cleisthenes, an Alcmaeonid who was believed to have bribed the Pythian priestess, and Isagoras, the son of Tisandrus, who belonged to a prominent family, although his exact lineage is unknown. His relatives, however, made sacrifices to Zeus of Caria. These two men and their factions fought for power, and Cleisthenes, who was losing the battle, decided to join forces with the common people. He then reorganized the Athenians into ten tribes instead of the previous four. He did not use the names of the sons of Ion—Geleon, Aegicores, Argades, and Hoples—for the tribes, but instead chose names from other local heroes, except for Aias. Cleisthenes included Aias, even though he was a foreigner, because he was a neighbor and an ally. 
67. In my opinion, Cleisthenes was imitating his maternal grandfather, Cleisthenes the tyrant of Sicyon, in his actions. After going to war with the Argives, Cleisthenes of Sicyon stopped minstrels' contests in his city because the Homeric poems mainly celebrated the Argives and Argos. He also wanted to expel Adrastus, the son of Talaus, an Argive hero whose shrine was located in Sicyon's marketplace. Cleisthenes went to Delphi and asked the oracle if he should banish Adrastus, but the priestess replied, "Adrastus is king of Sicyon, and you are just a stone thrower."  Unable to get the god's permission, Cleisthenes returned home and tried to find another way to get rid of Adrastus. He sent a message to Thebes in Boeotia, expressing his desire to bring Melanippus, the son of Astacus, to his country. The Thebans agreed and handed Melanippus over. Cleisthenes brought him to Sicyon and built a sanctuary for him in the government house, providing him with maximum security. The reason for bringing Melanippus was that he was Adrastus' greatest enemy, as Adrastus had killed his brother Mecisteus and his son-in-law Tydeus. Cleisthenes then took away all of Adrastus' sacrifices and festivals and gave them to Melanippus. The Sicyonians had greatly honored Adrastus because the country had once belonged to his maternal grandfather, Polybus, who died without an heir and left the kingship to Adrastus. Among other honors, the Sicyonians celebrated Adrastus' tragic fate with tragic choruses, not in honor of Dionysus but of Adrastus. Cleisthenes, however, returned the choruses to Dionysus and transferred the rest of the worship to Melanippus. 
68. Cleisthenes took several actions regarding Adrastus. He changed the names of the Dorian tribes so that the Sicyonians and Argives would not share them. In doing so, he made the Sicyonians a laughingstock, as he derived the new tribe names from the words 'donkey' and 'pig,' only altering the endings. However, he did not change the name of his own tribe in this manner. Instead, he gave it a name that reflected his rule, calling it Archelaoi, which means rulers of the people. The other tribes were named Swinites, Assites, and Porkites. These were the names of the tribes used by the Sicyonians during Cleisthenes' rule and for sixty years after his death. Eventually, they decided to change the names of the three tribes to Hylleis, Pamphyli, and Dymanatae, and added a fourth tribe called Aegialeis, named after Aegialeus, the son of Adrastus. 
69. The Sicyonian Cleisthenes had made these changes, and the Athenian Cleisthenes, inspired by his grandfather and namesake, decided to change the tribes' names, likely out of disdain for the Ionians. He wanted his tribes to be different from theirs. By gaining the support of the Athenian people, who were previously excluded from rights, he changed the tribes' names and increased their number. He created ten tribe-wardens instead of four and assigned ten districts to each tribe. With the people's support, he became much stronger than the opposing faction. 
70. Isagoras, who was losing, came up with a plan and sought help from Cleomenes, his friend since the time they besieged the Pisistratidae. It was even rumored that Cleomenes often visited Isagoras' wife. Cleomenes then sent a messenger to Athens, demanding the exile of Cleisthenes and many other Athenians, calling them the "Accursed." He did this following Isagoras' instructions, as the Alcmeonidae and their allies were believed to be responsible for a violent act, while Isagoras and his friends were not involved. 
71. I will now explain how the "Accursed" in Athens got their name. There was an Athenian named Cylon, who had won at the Olympic Games. He started acting like someone who wanted to become a tyrant and gathered a group of young men to try to take over the citadel. When they failed, they sought refuge near the goddess' statue. The leaders of Athens at that time, the presidents of the naval boards, removed Cylon and his men from their position. Although they were not supposed to be killed, they were executed, and the Alcmaeonidae were blamed for their deaths. All of this happened before the time of Pisistratus. 
72. When Cleomenes demanded the exile of Cleisthenes and the Accursed, Cleisthenes secretly left. Later, Cleomenes arrived in Athens with a small force. He banished 700 Athenian families, as suggested by Isagoras, to remove the curse. Then, he tried to dissolve the Council and give power to Isagoras' supporters. However, the Council resisted, and Cleomenes, Isagoras, and their allies took over the acropolis. The rest of the Athenians joined forces and besieged them for two days. On the third day, the Lacedaemonians left under a truce. Cleomenes' actions fulfilled a prophecy when he tried to enter the goddess' shrine in the acropolis. The priestess stopped him, saying that Dorians were not allowed inside. Cleomenes replied that he was not a Dorian but an Achaean. Ignoring the warning, he continued with his plans and was eventually expelled along with his Lacedaemonians. The remaining prisoners, including the strong and brave Timesitheus from Delphi, were sentenced to death by the Athenians. 
73. The Athenians executed these men and brought back Cleisthenes and the 700 families banished by Cleomenes. Wanting to form an alliance with the Persians, they sent messengers to Sardis, knowing they had angered the Lacedaemonians and Cleomenes, leading to war. When the messengers arrived in Sardis and delivered their message, Artaphrenes, the son of Hystaspes and ruler of Sardis, asked who they were and where they lived, as they sought an alliance with the Persians. After getting the information he needed, Artaphrenes told them that if the Athenians gave King Darius earth and water, he would form an alliance with them; otherwise, they should leave. The messengers discussed the matter and, eager to form the alliance, agreed to the terms. When they returned to Athens, they were heavily criticized for their decision. 
74. Cleomenes, knowing that the Athenians had wronged him in both words and actions, gathered an army from all over the Peloponnesus. He didn't reveal his true intention, which was to take revenge on the Athenian people and make Isagoras, who had left the acropolis with him, a tyrant. Cleomenes marched with a large force to Eleusis, while the Boeotians, following a plan, captured Oenoe and Hysiae, regions bordering Attica. At the same time, the Chalcidians attacked from another side, raiding lands in Attica. Surrounded by enemies, the Athenians decided to confront the Spartans at Eleusis and deal with the Boeotians and Chalcidians later. 
75. As the armies prepared for battle, the Corinthians realized they were making a mistake, changed their minds, and left. Demaratus, the other Spartan king and son of Ariston, also left, even though he had come with Cleomenes from Lacedaemon as a joint commander and had not disagreed with him until now. Because of this conflict, a law was created in Sparta that both kings could not go with the army when it was sent out. Previously, they had both gone together, but now one king and one of the sons of Tyndarus could stay behind. Before this, both of them were asked for help and went with the army. At Eleusis, when the other allies saw the disagreement between the Lacedaemonian kings and the departure of the Corinthians, they also left. 
76. This marked the fourth time that the Dorians had entered Attica. They had come twice as invaders and twice as helpers of the Athenian people. The first time was when they established a settlement at Megara (which can be considered to have happened during the reign of Codrus). The second and third times were when they left Sparta to expel the sons of Pisistratus. The fourth time was now, when Cleomenes and his Peloponnesian followers advanced as far as Eleusis. So, this was the fourth Dorian invasion of Athens. 
77. When this force was disgracefully dispersed, the Athenians decided to punish the Chalcidians first. The Boeotians came to Euripus to help the Chalcidians, and when the Athenians saw them, they chose to attack the Boeotians before the Chalcidians. In the battle against the Boeotians, the Athenians achieved a great victory, killing many and capturing 700 prisoners. On the same day, they crossed to Euboea and defeated the Chalcidians in battle as well. They then left 4,000 tenant farmers on the lands of the wealthy Chalcidians, known as horse-breeders. The Athenians captured and imprisoned many of these horse-breeders, along with the Boeotian prisoners. Eventually, they released them for a ransom of two minae each. The chains used to bind the prisoners were hung in the acropolis, where they could still be seen during my time, hanging from walls damaged by the Persians' fire, opposite the west-facing temple. They also dedicated a tenth of the ransom money to create a four-horse chariot, which stands on the left side of the entrance to the outer porch of the acropolis, with the following inscription: "Athens fought with Chalcis and Boeotia, Bound them in chains and brought their pride to naught. Prison was grief, and ransom cost them dear- One tenth to Pallas raised this chariot here." 
78. The Athenians became more powerful and demonstrated that equality is beneficial in every aspect. This is evident from the fact that when they were ruled by tyrants, the Athenians were no better in war than their neighbors. However, once they overthrew their tyrants, they became the best among all. This shows that when they were oppressed, they acted like fearful servants, but when they gained freedom, each individual was motivated to succeed for themselves. 
79. The Athenians took this course of action, and the Thebans, wanting revenge on Athens, later sought advice from Delphi. The Pythian priestess told them that they wouldn't be able to get the revenge they wanted on their own and that they should ask the "many-voiced" and request help from their "nearest." When the envoys returned, a meeting was held, and the oracle's message was shared. Hearing that they must ask their "nearest" for help, the Thebans said, "If that's the case, our closest neighbors are the people of Tanagra, Coronea, and Thespiae. They always fight alongside us in battles and actively support our wars. So, why do we need to ask them for help? Maybe this is what the oracle means." 
80. They discussed the issue until finally, one person understood and said, "I think I know what the oracle is trying to tell us. Thebe and Aegina were daughters of Asopus and sisters. I believe the god's message is that we should ask the Aeginetans to help us take revenge." Realizing that there was no better idea, they immediately sent a request to the Aeginetans for assistance, as the oracle had instructed, since they were their closest allies. The Aeginetans responded that they would send the Sons of Aeacus to help. 
81. The Thebans, relying on their alliance with the Aeginetans, went to battle but were defeated by the Athenians. After this, they sent another message to Aegina, returning the Sons of Aeacus and asking for soldiers instead. The Aeginetans, who were thriving and still held a grudge against Athens, agreed to help the Thebans and waged war on the Athenians without any formal warning. While the Athenians were occupied with the Boeotians, the Aeginetans attacked Attica with their warships, raiding Phaleron and several other coastal towns. This caused significant damage to the Athenians. 
82. The Aeginetans began their long-lasting rivalry with the Athenians due to these events. Meanwhile, the Epidaurians faced a problem as their land didn't produce any crops. They sought advice from the Delphi oracle, and the priestess told them to create statues of Damia and Auxesia, promising that their fortunes would improve. The Epidaurians then asked if they should make the statues from bronze or stone, but the priestess suggested using wood from cultivated olive trees instead. The Epidaurians requested permission from the Athenians to cut down some olive trees, believing that the ones in Athens were the most sacred. In fact, it is said that at that time, olive trees only existed in Athens. The Athenians agreed to provide the trees if the Epidaurians would pay annual tribute to Athena, the city's goddess, and Erechtheus. The Epidaurians accepted this condition, and their request was granted. After setting up the statues made from the olive trees, the Epidaurians' land became fruitful, and they kept their agreement with the Athenians. 
83. During this time, the Aeginetans were still under the control of the Epidaurians and even went to Epidaurus to settle their personal disputes. However, they soon began building ships and started to rebel against the Epidaurians. In the process, they caused significant damage to the Epidaurians and stole their statues of Damia and Auxesia. They placed these statues in a location called Oea, about twenty furlongs away from their city. The Aeginetans tried to gain the favor of the statues by offering sacrifices and organizing female choruses that performed satirical and insulting songs. Ten men were chosen to arrange a chorus for each deity, and the songs targeted not men but the local women. The Epidaurians also had similar rituals, along with some secret ones. 
84. When the statues were stolen, the Epidaurians stopped fulfilling their agreement with the Athenians. In response, the Athenians sent an angry message to the Epidaurians, who argued that they were not in the wrong. They said that as long as the statues were in their country, they had kept their agreement. However, now that they had lost the statues, it wasn't fair for them to continue paying. They suggested that the Athenians should ask the Aeginetans, who had the statues, for their dues. So, the Athenians went to Aegina and demanded the return of the statues. However, the Aeginetans replied that they had no obligation to the Athenians. 
85. The Athenians claim that after making their demand, they sent a single ship with some citizens to Aegina, representing the entire population. They tried to remove the statues, arguing that they were made from Athenian wood, and take them back to Athens. However, they couldn't remove the statues easily, so they tied ropes around them to drag them away.  While they were trying to do this, a thunderstorm and an earthquake struck. The crew on the ship became so terrified and confused that they started attacking each other as if they were enemies. In the end, only one person survived and returned alone to Phalerum. 
86. The Athenians tell their side of the story, but the Aeginetans have a different version. They say that the Athenians didn't come with just one ship, as they could have easily defended against that, or even multiple ships, even without a navy of their own. According to the Aeginetans, the Athenians arrived with many ships and they didn't resist, but it's unclear if they did so because they felt weaker in sea battles or if they had another plan in mind. When the Athenians couldn't find anyone to fight them, they went ashore and tried to take the statues. They couldn't remove them from their bases, so they tied ropes around them and dragged them until both statues fell on their knees. The statues have remained in that position ever since. While this is what the Athenians claim to have happened, the Aeginetans say that they knew the Athenians were planning to attack them, so they sought help from the Argives. The Argives secretly crossed over from Epidaurus to Aegina to help the Aeginetans. They ambushed the Athenians, cutting them off from their ships. It was at this moment that the thunderstorm and earthquake occurred. 
87. The Argives and Aeginetans tell this story, and the Athenians also agree that only one man from their group made it back to Attica. However, the Argives say that this man escaped after they defeated the rest of the Athenian force, while the Athenians believe that divine power was responsible. This lone survivor didn't live long, as he met a tragic end. When he returned to Athens and told everyone about the disaster, the wives of the men who had gone to attack Aegina were furious that he was the only one who survived. They surrounded him and stabbed him with the pins from their clothes, each woman asking where her husband was. This man's death was seen as even more terrible than the Athenians' earlier misfortune. The Athenians couldn't think of any other way to punish the women for their actions, so they decided to change their style of dress to the Ionian fashion. Before this, Athenian women wore Dorian clothing, which was similar to Corinthian attire. By changing to the linen tunic, the women would no longer have sharp brooch-pins to use as weapons. 
88. However, the truth is that this style of dress is not originally Ionian, but Carian. In the past, all women in Greece wore the costume now called Dorian. As for the Argives and Aeginetans, they made a law in both their countries that brooch-pins should be half as long as before, and brooches should be the main offerings made by women in the shrines of these two goddesses. Additionally, they decided that nothing from Attica, not even pottery, should be brought to the temple. From that time on, only locally made drinking vessels were to be used. 
89. Since that day, even up to my time, the women of Argos and Aegina wore longer brooch-pins because of their feud with the Athenians. The hostility between the Athenians and Aeginetans began as I have mentioned, and now, when the Thebans called for help, the Aeginetans eagerly joined them, remembering the issue with the statues. While the Aeginetans attacked the coast of Attica, the Athenians prepared to fight back, but an oracle from Delphi advised them to wait for thirty years after the Aeginetans' wrongdoing, and in the thirty-first year, they should dedicate a sacred area to Aeacus and then start the war with Aegina. By doing this, they would succeed. However, if they attacked immediately, they would eventually win but would suffer and face many challenges in the meantime. When the Athenians heard this, they dedicated the sacred area to Aeacus in their marketplace, but they couldn't bear to wait for thirty years, as they felt the Aeginetans had wronged them terribly. 
90. As they prepared for revenge, an issue that started in Lacedaemon stopped them. When the Lacedaemonians learned about the Alcmaeonids' plot with the Pythian priestess and her scheme against them and the Pisistratidae, they became very angry for two reasons: they had driven their own guests and friends from their country, and the Athenians showed no gratitude for their actions. Moreover, they were motivated by the oracles that predicted many hostile acts against them by the Athenians. They had not known about these oracles before, but now Cleomenes brought them to Sparta, and the Lacedaemonians learned their contents. Cleomenes took the oracles from the Athenian acropolis, which had been in the possession of the Pisistratidae earlier. When they were exiled, they left the oracles in the temple, from where Cleomenes retrieved them. 
91. The Lacedaemonians, after getting the oracles back and seeing the Athenians growing in power and unwilling to obey them, realized that if the Athenians remained free, they would become as powerful as themselves. However, if they were under tyranny, they would be weak and submissive. Understanding this, they brought Pisistratus' son Hippias from Sigeum on the Hellespont, where the Pisistratidae had taken refuge. When Hippias arrived, the Spartans called for representatives from their allies and spoke to them: "Dear allies, we admit that we have made a mistake. We were misled by false prophecies and drove our close friends from their homeland, promising to make Athens subject to us. But when we gave Athens its freedom, the ungrateful people turned against us and our king. Now, their pride and power are growing so much that their neighbors in Boeotia and Chalcis have taken notice, and others will soon realize their mistake too. Since we made an error, we will now try to take revenge on them with your help. That's why we have brought Hippias here and called you from your cities, so that we can unite our plans and power, bring Hippias to Athens, and restore what we took away." 
92. The Lacedaemonians' words were not well-received by most of their allies. While the others remained silent, Socles, a Corinthian, spoke up: "It seems the world has turned upside down now that you, Lacedaemonians, are trying to destroy democracy and bring back tyranny to the cities, which is the most unjust and cruel thing on earth. If you think it's good for cities to be ruled by tyrants, establish one in your own city first, then try to do the same for others. However, you, who have never experienced tyranny and take great care to prevent it in Sparta, are treating your allies unfairly. If you had experienced tyranny like we have, you would be more cautious in your advice." The Corinthian state was organized in a way I will describe. There was an oligarchy, and a group of men called the Bacchiadae ruled the city, marrying within their own circle. One of them, Amphion, had a disabled daughter named Labda. Since none of the Bacchiadae would marry her, she married Eetion, son of Echecrates, from the village of Petra. When Eetion couldn't have children with Labda or any other wife, he went to Delphi to ask about having children. As soon as he entered, the Pythian priestess gave him an oracle that was somehow revealed to the Bacchiadae. They didn't understand the earlier oracle sent to Corinth, which had the same meaning as Eetion's oracle. When they heard Eetion's oracle, they understood it immediately and recognized its similarity to the earlier one. Now understanding both oracles, they kept quiet but planned to kill Eetion's child. When Labda gave birth, they sent ten men from their clan to Petra to kill the child. These men went to Eetion's house and asked for the child. Labda, unaware of their intentions and thinking they wanted to see the baby out of affection for its father, brought it to them. They had planned to kill the child by having the first man who received it smash it to the ground. However, when Labda handed the child over, it smiled at the man who took it, and he couldn't bring himself to kill it. Filled with pity, he passed it to the next man, and so on, until all ten men had held the child but none had killed it. They returned the child to its mother and left, arguing among themselves about who was to blame for not killing the child. Eventually, they decided to go back in and all participate in the killing. However, fate had decreed that Eetion's child would bring trouble to Corinth, and Labda, who had overheard their conversation, hid the child in a chest to protect it. The men returned and searched the house but couldn't find the child, so they left and told their superiors that they had carried out their orders. Eetion's son grew up and was named Cypselus after the chest. When he became a man, he sought a divination and received a double-meaning oracle at Delphi. Trusting this oracle, he seized control of Corinth. Cypselus, once in power, exiled many Corinthians, took their wealth, and killed many others. After ruling for thirty years, he died and was succeeded by his son Periander, who became even more ruthless than his father after consulting with Thrasybulus, the tyrant of Miletus. Periander's rule was marked by violence and cruelty. In a single day, he stripped all the women of Corinth naked because of a message from his dead wife, Melissa. After following her instructions and sending a second message, Melissa's ghost told him where a friend's deposit was hidden. The Corinthians were surprised when they saw the Lacedaemonians sending for Hippias and were even more shocked by their words. They begged the Lacedaemonians not to establish tyranny in the cities and warned that if they tried to bring Hippias back, they would do so without the Corinthians' consent. 
93. Socles, the representative from Corinth, spoke these words, and Hippias responded by calling upon the same gods that Socles had invoked as witnesses. Hippias said that the Corinthians would be the first to want the Pisistratidae back when the time came for them to be troubled by the Athenians. Hippias made this statement because he had a better understanding of the oracles than anyone else. Hearing Socles' bold words, the rest of the allies, who had been silent until now, spoke up and agreed with the Corinthians. They pleaded with the Lacedaemonians not to harm a Greek city. 
94. Hippias' plan failed, and he was forced to leave. Amyntas, the king of the Macedonians, offered him Anthemus, and the Thessalians offered Iolcus, but he refused both. Instead, he went to Sigeum, which Pisistratus had taken from the Mytilenaeans and where he had placed Hegesistratus, his illegitimate son with an Argive woman, as the ruler. However, Hegesistratus couldn't maintain control of what Pisistratus had given him without fighting, as there was a long-lasting war between the Athenians at Sigeum and the Mytilenaeans at Achilleum. The Mytilenaeans wanted the place back, but the Athenians argued that the Aeolians had no more claim to the land of Ilium than they or any other Greeks who had helped Menelaus avenge Helen's abduction, and they refused to give it up. 
95. During this war, one particular event stands out. In a battle where the Athenians were winning, the poet Alcaeus fled and escaped, but his armor was captured by the Athenians and displayed in the temple of Athena at Sigeum. Alcaeus wrote a poem about this incident and sent it to Mytilene, telling his friend Melanippus about his misfortune. As for the Mytilenaeans and Athenians, they eventually made peace through the mediation of Periander, son of Cypselus, who they agreed to let decide the matter. The terms of the peace were that each side would keep what they had. 
96. Sigeum eventually came under Athenian control. Meanwhile, Hippias went to Asia from Lacedaemon and tried his best to persuade Artaphrenes to help him and Darius take over Athens by speaking ill of the Athenians. When the Athenians found out about this, they sent messengers to Sardis, warning the Persians not to trust exiled Athenians. However, Artaphrenes told them to accept Hippias back if they wanted to be safe. The Athenians refused this proposal, and as a result, they decided to openly declare war against Persia. 
97. When the Athenians decided to oppose Persia and were on bad terms with them, Aristagoras from Miletus, who had been rejected by Cleomenes of Sparta, came to Athens, as it was the most powerful city. He spoke to the people about the riches of Asia and how the Persians, who didn't use shields or spears in battle, could be easily defeated. He also mentioned that the Milesians were originally from Athens and that it was their duty to help them. Aristagoras made many promises in his passionate plea, eventually convincing the Athenians. It seems that it's easier to deceive many people than just one, as Aristagoras couldn't deceive Cleomenes of Sparta, but he managed to deceive thirty thousand Athenians. Persuaded, the Athenians voted to send twenty ships to help the Ionians, with Melanthius, a respected Athenian citizen, as their admiral. These ships marked the beginning of troubles for both Greeks and foreigners. 
98. Aristagoras arrived in Miletus before the others and came up with a plan that wouldn't benefit the Ionians but would annoy King Darius. He sent a man to Phrygia, where the Paeonians, who had been captured by Megabazus and forced to live in a separate village, were staying. The man told the Paeonians that Aristagoras, the ruler of Miletus, had a plan for their escape if they were willing to follow it. Since all of Ionia was rebelling against the king, they could return to their homeland, and they would be taken care of afterward. The Paeonians were happy to hear this news, and although some stayed behind out of fear, the rest gathered their families and fled to the sea. They crossed over to Chios, but a large group of Persian horsemen pursued them. Unable to catch up, the Persians sent a message to Chios, ordering the Paeonians to return. The Paeonians refused and were taken from Chios to Lesbos by the Chians, and then from Lesbos to Doriscus by the Lesbians. From there, they traveled by land back to Paeonia. 
99. The Athenians arrived with their twenty ships, along with five triremes from the Eretrians, who joined the war not to please the Athenians but to repay a debt to the Milesians. This was because the Milesians had once helped the Eretrians in a war against Chalcis, when the Samians had supported the Chalcidians against the Eretrians and Milesians. When the Athenians, Eretrians, and other allies arrived, Aristagoras planned an attack on Sardis. However, he stayed in Miletus and appointed two generals to lead the Milesian army: his brother Charopinus and another citizen named Hermophantus. 
100. When the Ionians arrived in Ephesus with their army, they left their ships at Coresus, which was in Ephesian territory. They then marched inland, guided by Ephesians, and followed the Caicus River. After crossing the Tmolus mountain, they reached Sardis and captured it easily, facing no resistance. The only part they didn't take was the citadel, which was defended by Artaphrenes and a large number of soldiers. 
101. The Ionians couldn't loot the city because most of the houses in Sardis were made of reeds, and even the brick houses had reed roofs. When a soldier accidentally set one house on fire, the flames quickly spread throughout the entire city. As the city burned, the Lydians and Persians trapped in the citadel had no way out, since the fire was consuming the outer parts of the city. They gathered in the marketplace and near the river Pactolus, which flowed through the marketplace, carrying gold dust from the Tmolus mountain and eventually joining the Hermus River before reaching the sea. The Lydians and Persians were forced to defend themselves in the marketplace. When the Ionians saw their enemies fighting back and a large number of others approaching, they became scared and retreated to the Tmolus mountain. At nightfall, they left the mountain and returned to their ships. 
102. During the fire in Sardis, a temple dedicated to Cybebe, the local goddess, was destroyed. The Persians later used this as an excuse to burn the temples in Hellas. Meanwhile, the Persians from the provinces near the Halys River heard about the situation and came to help the Lydians. They arrived after the Ionians had already left Sardis, but they managed to catch up with them at Ephesus. A battle took place in Ephesus, where the Ionians were completely defeated. The Persians killed many notable men, including Eualcides, the general of the Eretrians, who had been a champion in the games and highly praised by the poet Simonides of Ceos. The surviving Ionians fled the battle and returned to their respective cities. 
103. The battle ended with the Ionians suffering great losses. After this, the Athenians decided to completely separate themselves from the Ionians and refused to help them, even though Aristagoras sent urgent messages asking for assistance. Despite losing their Athenian allies, the Ionians remained determined to continue their fight against King Darius, as they were already deeply committed to the cause. The Ionians sailed to the Hellespont and managed to take control of Byzantium and all the other cities in the region. Then, they sailed out from the Hellespont and gained the support of most of Caria. Even the city of Caunus, which had previously refused to join the Ionians, decided to ally with them after the burning of Sardis. 
104. The people of Cyprus also decided to join the rebellion against the Medes, except for the people of Amathus. The reason for this revolt was as follows: Onesilus, the younger brother of Gorgus, the king of Salamis, had always encouraged Gorgus to rebel against Darius. When he heard that the Ionians had revolted, he became even more insistent. However, Gorgus remained unconvinced. Taking advantage of Gorgus's absence from the city of Salamis, Onesilus and his supporters closed the city gates, effectively locking Gorgus out. Gorgus, having lost his city, sought refuge with the Medes. Onesilus then became the king of Salamis and managed to persuade all of Cyprus to join the revolt, except for the Amathusians, who refused to participate. As a result, Onesilus gathered his forces and laid siege to the city of Amathus. 
105. Onesilus continued to besiege Amathus. When Darius heard that Sardis had been captured and burned by the Athenians and Ionians, and that Aristagoras of Miletus had led the plot, he initially didn't pay much attention to the Ionians, believing they would eventually be punished for their rebellion. However, he did ask who the Athenians were. After getting an answer, he grabbed his bow, placed an arrow on it, and shot it into the sky, praying to Zeus, "Please, let me take revenge on the Athenians." Then, he instructed one of his servants to remind him three times during each meal, "Master, don't forget about the Athenians." 
106. After giving his order, Darius summoned Histiaeus, the Milesian who had been with him for a long time. He said, "Histiaeus, I've heard that the deputy you appointed in Miletus has betrayed me. He brought men from the mainland, convinced some Ionians—who will pay for their actions—to join them, and took Sardis from me. Do you think this is right? How could this happen without your knowledge? Be careful not to blame yourself later." Histiaeus replied, "My lord, why would I plan something that could harm you in any way? I have everything I want, and I'm trusted with all your decisions. If my deputy did what you say, it must have been his own doing. I can't even believe the news that the Milesians and my deputy are causing you such trouble. However, if it's true and what you've heard is accurate, then it seems your decision to make me leave the coast was unwise. As soon as I was gone, the Ionians did what they had always wanted. If I had been in Ionia, no city would have dared to act. Now, please send me to Ionia immediately, so I can bring peace to the region and hand over the rebellious deputy of Miletus. Once I've done this, I swear by the gods of your royal house that I won't take off the tunic I'm wearing when I arrive in Ionia until I've made Sardo, the largest of the islands, a tributary to you." 
107. Histiaeus successfully tricked Darius with his words. Darius agreed to let him go, but instructed Histiaeus to return to Susa after he had accomplished what he had promised. 
108. While the news about Sardis was reaching the king, and Darius had done what I mentioned with his bow and allowed Histiaeus to go to the sea, the following events occurred. Onesilus of Salamis was besieging the people of Amathus when he heard that Artybius, a Persian, was expected to arrive in Cyprus with a large Persian army. Hearing this, Onesilus sent messengers throughout Ionia to gather support, and the Ionians quickly responded with a significant force. The Ionians arrived in Cyprus just as the Persians, coming from Cilicia, marched towards Salamis by land, while the Phoenicians sailed around the headland known as the keys of Cyprus. 
109. In response to the situation, the rulers of Cyprus gathered the Ionian generals and gave them a choice: either fight the Persians on land or the Phoenicians at sea. They said, "Ionians, if you want to face the Persians on land, then disembark and prepare for battle, and we will take your ships to fight the Phoenicians. If you prefer to fight the Phoenicians, do so, but make sure that both Ionia and Cyprus become free." The Ionians replied, "We were sent by the united voice of Ionia to protect the seas, not to hand over our ships to the Cypriots and fight the Persians on land. We will do our best in the task assigned to us. It's up to you to show your courage, remembering the suffering you endured under Median rule." 
110. The Ionians responded in this way, and later, when the Persian army arrived at the plain of Salamis, the Cypriot kings arranged their troops. They positioned the best Salaminian and Solian soldiers against the Persians, while the rest of the Cypriots faced the other parts of the enemy's army. Onesilus took his position directly opposite Artybius, the Persian general. 
111. Upon learning that Artybius' horse was trained to fight infantrymen by rearing up, Onesilus spoke to his brave Carian attendant, who was well-known for his skills in battle. He said, "I've heard that Artybius' horse rears up and attacks anyone it encounters. Considering this, decide and tell me who you'll focus on striking down: Artybius or his horse." His attendant replied, "My King, I'm ready to do either or both, as you wish. However, I'll tell you what I think is best for you. In my opinion, a king and general should face another king and general in battle. If you defeat a general, it's a great accomplishment. If he defeats you, which I hope won't happen, it's less of a tragedy to be killed by a noble enemy. As for us servants, it's appropriate that we fight against other servants and that horse. Don't worry about its tricks; I promise it will never fight anyone again." 
112. The attendant replied in this way, and soon after, battles erupted on both land and sea. The Ionians, showing exceptional skill that day, defeated the Phoenicians in their ships, with the Samnians being the bravest. On land, the armies clashed and fought. The two generals, Artybius and Onesilus, faced each other as agreed with his attendant. As Artybius charged towards him, Onesilus struck a blow. When the horse hit Onesilus' shield with its hooves, the Carian swiftly cut off the horse's legs with a swing of his curved sword. 
113. In this manner, Artybius, the Persian general, and his horse were defeated. While the battle continued, Stesenor, the ruler of Curium, believed to be an Argive settlement, betrayed his side with a large group of men under his command. The Salaminian war-chariots quickly followed suit, giving the Persians an advantage over the Cyprians. As a result, the Cyprian army was defeated, and many were killed, including Onesilus, son of Chersis, who had orchestrated the Cyprian rebellion, and Aristocyprus, the king of the Solians and son of Philocyprus. Philocyprus was the one whom Solon of Athens praised above all other rulers in a poem during his visit to Cyprus. 
114. When Onesilus was killed, the people of Amathus cut off his head and hung it above their city gates, as he had once laid siege to their city. Over time, the head became hollow and a swarm of bees filled it with honeycomb. The Amathusians, curious about this event, sought advice from an oracle. The oracle told them to remove the head, bury it, and offer an annual sacrifice to Onesilus as if he were a hero. By doing so, they were promised that their lives would improve. 
115. The Amathusians followed the oracle's advice and continued to do so ever since. Meanwhile, the Ionians who fought the sea battle near Cyprus found out that Onesilus' cause had failed and that all Cypriot cities, except for Salamis, which was returned to its former king Gorgus by the Salaminians, were under siege. So, they quickly sailed back to Ionia. Among the besieged cities, Soli held out the longest. The Persians finally captured it in the fifth month by digging a tunnel under its walls. 
116. The Cyprians, who had enjoyed freedom for a year, were once again enslaved. Daurises, Hymaees, and Otanes, all Persian generals and sons-in-law of Darius, chased the Ionians who had marched to Sardis and forced them to retreat to their ships. Following their victory, the Persian generals divided the conquered cities among themselves and plundered them. 
117. Daurises quickly captured the cities of the Hellespont, including Dardanus, Abydus, Percote, Lampsacus, and Paesus, each in just one day. While he was on his way from Paesus to attack Parius, he received news that the Carians had joined forces with the Ionians and rebelled against the Persians. As a result, he changed his course from the Hellespont and led his army towards Caria. 
118. News of Daurises' approach reached the Carians before his arrival. Upon hearing this, they gathered at a place called the White Pillars, near the Marsyas River, which flows from the Idria region and merges with the Maeander River. Many strategies were discussed, and the best one, in my opinion, came from Pixodarus of Cindya, the son of Mausolus and husband of the daughter of Syennesis, the king of Cilicia. He suggested that the Carians should cross the Maeander River and fight with the river behind them. This would force them to be braver, as they wouldn't be able to retreat. However, this idea was not accepted. Instead, they decided to position the Persians, not the Carians, with the Maeander River at their back. The intention was that if the Persians were defeated and forced to flee, they would not escape but be thrown into the river. 
119. Soon, the Persians arrived and crossed the Maeander River, engaging in battle with the Carians by the Marsyas River. The Carians fought fiercely and for a long time, but eventually, they were defeated due to the Persians' superior numbers. About two thousand Persians and ten thousand Carians were killed in the battle. The surviving Carians retreated to the sacred grove of Zeus of Armies at Labraunda, which was filled with large, holy plane trees. (The Carians are the only people known to worship Zeus under this name.) Once there, they discussed their options for survival, debating whether to surrender to the Persians or leave Asia altogether. 
120. As the Carians were discussing their options, help arrived in the form of the Milesians and their allies. With this support, the Carians abandoned their previous plans and decided to continue fighting. However, when they faced the Persians again, they suffered an even greater defeat than before. Many soldiers from both sides were killed, but the Milesians were hit the hardest. 
121. Despite their losses, the Carians didn't give up and prepared to fight again. They learned that the Persians were planning to march towards their cities, so they set up an ambush at Pedasus. The Persians unknowingly walked into this trap at night and were defeated, along with their generals Daurises, Amorges, and Sisimaces. Myrsus, the son of Gyges, also perished in the battle. The mastermind behind this ambush was Heraclides of Mylasas, the son of Ibanollis. 
122. This is how those Persians met their end. Hymaees, who had been chasing the Ionians that attacked Sardis, turned his attention towards the Propontis and captured Cius in Mysia. Upon hearing that Daurises had left the Hellespont and was heading towards Caria, Hymaees left the Propontis and led his army to the Hellespont. He conquered all the Aeolians living in the Ilium region and the Gergithae, who were descendants of the ancient Trojans. However, while he was in the process of conquering these lands, Hymaees fell ill and died in the Troad. 
123. This is how he died. After his death, Artaphrenes, the governor of Sardis, and Otanes, the third general, were chosen to lead the army against Ionia and the neighboring Aeolian region. They successfully captured Clazomenae in Ionia and Cyme in Aeolia. 
124. Aristagoras of Miletus, as it became evident, was not a very brave man. After causing chaos in Ionia, he realized the consequences of his actions and started thinking about escaping. He also believed that it was impossible to defeat Darius. As cities were being captured, he gathered his fellow rebels to discuss their options. He suggested that they should have a backup plan in case they were forced out of Miletus. He asked them whether they should move to a settlement in Sardo or Myrcinus in Edonia, which Histiaeus had received as a gift from Darius and had fortified. 
125. The historian Hecataeus, son of Hegesander, disagreed with both options. He suggested that instead of going to either of those places, Aristagoras should build a stronghold on the island of Leros and live there if he was forced out of Miletus. Later, he could use Leros as a base to return to Miletus. 
126. Hecataeus gave his advice, but Aristagoras decided it was better to go to Myrcinus. He left Miletus in the hands of Pythagoras, a respected citizen, and set sail to Thrace with anyone who wanted to join him. Once there, he took control of the place. However, he and his army were killed by the Thracians while attacking a town, even though the Thracians were willing to leave it under a treaty.
